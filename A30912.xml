            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HEre is offered to thy view and conſideration, ſome of thoſe great good things to come; which will take place at the coming of the Lord Chriſt in power and great glory: the certaintie of them is great: the faithfulneſs of God is engaged to make them good, and his power none can queſtion: for encouragement to hope and wait patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly until the appointed time come of their fulfilling: they were collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſet forth alſo; and likewiſe that the further knowledge and underſtanding of them might take place, and the vails removed that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the breaking forth of the light thereof. The time haſteneth; the day draweth nigh; ſome further light would be very comfortable to the bleſſed expectances of his coming. It is expected that the making of it publike, will be differently reſented; ſome it may be will diſlike it, or ſomething in it, as fabulous; ſome haply will decry it, as holding forth ſomething er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; ſome, that thoſe things are not ſo neceſſary for theſe times; others, it is likely, may be well pleaſed and glad of them; and being ſuch things as they have not thought of, will conſider ſoberly of them, and it may be ſome fruit may follow for the further advancing the knowledge of the coming of the Lord Chriſt and his kingdom, and all thoſe great things ſpoken of in the ſcriptures of truth, that ſhall come and take place at that happy day. Though there ſeems much in the ſpirits of ſome againſt it; yet notwithſtanding the further knowledge of theſe things gets ground, and is much on the ſpirits and hearts of <hi>many</hi> of the good ſervants of God and lovers of the Lord Jeſus, whom nothing pleaſeth more, and maketh their hearts glad and joyful, then to hear of the coming of their dear ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour again; and it is likely, it will be ſo, more and more, as the day thereof draweth nigh; ſomething of the good ſpirits of God in the bride, will cauſe this deſire, and cauſe it to grow higher and higher: <hi>the ſpirit and the bride, will ſay come: oh come Lord Jeſus come quickly:</hi> this matter was much on the ſpirits of the bleſſed ſervants of God of old, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. 11. who comprehenſively ſpeaking of the great ſalvation, not only in the beginnings, but alſo in the full and final compleating of it, ſayth, <hi>Of which ſalvation the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have enquired and ſearched diligently,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Searching what, or what manner of time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They</hi> ſearched, what, about the ſufferings and glory; and what manner of time. 1ſt. <hi>In regard of his coming in the ſtate of humiliation to ſuffer,</hi> And 2ly. <hi>His coming in glory to</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:106759:2"/> 
                     <hi>reign:</hi> the ſpirit of Chriſt in them did ſignifie, declare, and ſhow, afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, the ſufferings of the Lord Chriſt, which they alſo declared afore hand, and they came all to paſſe: and the glory that ſhould follow after; which is yet to come, and looked for by the ſervants of God, and ſhall be made good as the others were, when our Lord ſhall come in the glory of his father, and of all the holy Angels. And as the prophets of God in the old teſtament, and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſince in the new (as in the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſcripture, and in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 18. to 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 4. 2. 13. 14.) have ſpoken of, and looked for his great ſalvation: ſo, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> have therein likewiſe told, of the great things, that will attend and take place, at the time of that glorious coming of our Lord: <hi>when he appeareth, we alſo ſhall appear with him in glory, Col.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Be like him, and ſee him as he is, John.</hi> 3. 2. ſhall not only behold his glory and admire him, but be alſo glorifyed and admired in them. 2 <hi>The.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>ſhall be ever with him,</hi> 1 <hi>The.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>His taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle with them, and he dwelling amongſt them: they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God, Rev.</hi> 21. 3. <hi>And being made kings and Preiſts unto God, by Chriſt, ſhall reign with him upon the earth, Rev.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. 5. 6. The bleſſed Reſtoration or reſtitution of all things; <hi>a new heaven and a new earth</hi> (very heavenly): and all things made new. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 19. 20. 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1. 5. True and faithful ſayings: in the general, or for the matter of them, foretold and confirmed by our Lord himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death; as in ſeveral places in the four Evangeliſts; and alſo more particularly and plainly ſince his reſurrection and aſcention, as in this book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which is his, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. and given him by God the father to communicate to his ſervants for their joy and comfort; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then, and there, that bleſſed potentate, king of kings, and Lord of Lords, the Lord Jeſus, ſhall reign gloriouſly; and the kingdom, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, ſhall come into the hands of the ſaints of the moſt high God, as <hi>Daniel hath</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. alſo Chriſt himſelf, and <hi>John,</hi> as is before mentioned. In the world to come, after the burning and deſtroying of this 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. to 13. will this it is very likely take place; when the righteous will flouriſh indeed, and be happy: as now they may comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly rejoyce in hope of the glory of God: for then, <hi>there will be no more curſe:</hi> [neither in reſpect of the creation, nor the throne of the beaſt or Antichriſt] <hi>but the throne of God, and of the lamb ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him,</hi> to the fulfilling of <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106759:3"/>
                  <p>There are ſome general notions, and common ſayings amongſt perſons religious, and profeſſing much love to the Lord Chriſt, and deſire of the advancement of his glory, both here and hereafter, and yet they do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſtruct and hinder the advance of the knowledge of his coming.</p>
                  <p>The firſt obſtruction we mention, is a decrying of it as a thing not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, but a thing newly ſtarted up or revived: the <hi>Milleniant Tenent,</hi> which they that are orthodox meddle not with: it is much to hear any that profeſſe love to the Lord Jeſus, to ſpeak ſo at this time of the day: and to fright themſelves, and others with ſuch a bugbear, and thereby to hinder themſelves, and others, from ſearching or making enquiry into the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures concerning the good things to come: whenas ſome have outlived the notions and wayes they counted orthodox; and have cloſed with, and adhered unto, in notion and practice, the things they counted heterodox, and it may be, they may do ſo again. This fallacie of being orthodox, is but an aiery notion: a name only: the religious tenents, and practiſes ſetled by power, in any nation or countrey are orthodox there, where they are ſo ſetled; and all other diſſonant tenents to the eſtabliſhment are counted heterodox, though they be never ſo right tenents: the Papiſts will ſo decry the Proteſtants of all kinds, the Proteſtants do the like, and will when they are ſetled by power decry as heterodox the Papiſt; and every different party amongſt all ſorts of Chriſtians, are apt to baptize their own opinion as orthodox, and all diſſenters as heterodox, and the diſſenter will do the like back again; ſo as in effect this bugbear ſignifieth nothing at all but is as a ſhaddow. Another thing obſtructing is a common notion, and ſpeaking inconſideratly of the world to come, of which the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. As that which ſball take place, when this world ſball give place, be burned, and be no more, which by many is quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked; and by ſome counted as heaven above: as if nothing was to be here below, after the burning and end of this world, but heaven and being in heaven. Nay, in common ſpeaking ſome tell of going to heaven before this world have an end; not taking notice of <hi>the world to come</hi> at all: and very hardly admitting it to be any other thing, then heaven above, as was ſaid before; by which notion and ſpeaking, they make void &amp; inſignificant, much of the holy ſcriptures, and the ſayings of the Lord Chriſt, the Apoſtles and prophets therein, as concerning <hi>things to come.</hi> And to help in the caſe, they adventure to allegorize, and put ſpiritual meanings on plain prophecyes, propheſying thereby themſelves, inſtead of believing and receiving the ſayings of the prophets; though the prophets declared nothing but what God commanded them to ſpeak and
<pb facs="tcp:106759:3"/> declare. And in like manner they do by the holy viſions of <hi>John</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; declared and ſet forth in the holy ſcriptures; whereby the minds of perſons are diverted and taken off, from ſearching into the prophecies and looking out after the <hi>good things to come,</hi> and from the believing of them any otherwiſe, then they conceive they will ſute with heaven, and the ſtate of heaven above. So as the <hi>coming again of our Lord Chriſt, the coming of his kingdom, and his will done on earth as in heaven;</hi> which himſelf hath ſo greatly foretold, witneſſed to, and exhorted his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to pray for, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 10. The <hi>bleſſed reſtoration of all things, when he ſhall be ſent again,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Peter, Acts.</hi> 3. 19. 20. 21. The creatures <hi>deliverance from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God,</hi> called <hi>the adoption, or redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, which they who have the firſt-fruits of the ſpirit [viz.</hi> the hints of the glory thereof upon their ſpirits] <hi>and the whole creation,</hi> by a ſecret inſtinct, <hi>are ſaid to groan, travel in pain and wait to be delivered into, Rom.</hi> 8. 21. 22. 23. <hi>The new heaven, and new earth,</hi> and <hi>all things made new: the true and faithful ſayings, which our Lord Chriſt ſent and ſignified by his Angel to his ſervant John,</hi> The reading, hearing, keeping whereof, hath the promiſe of a bleſſing annexed to it, equal with, if not beyond any other part of the holy ſcriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. 3. with very many things more that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, will ſignifie little or nothing; but as they are made by ſome to hold forth ſome attainer, or enjoyment in heaven above.</p>
                  <p>Another hindrance of the knowledge, and looking out after the great good things to come, and which takes the mindes of perſons from ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looking out after them, is a narrow notion, received and held forth upon little ground but tradition, namely, <hi>that the Lord Chriſt will come at the day of judgement, to judge the quick and the dead,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſhort ſummary in the Creed: and in, and under this, is by ſome, wrapped up, all the things ſpoken of in the ſcriptures, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ends of his coming again; without taking any notice of them at all; ſo as if you ſpeak of <hi>Chriſt our Lord, coming in glory to take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him his great power and to ſet up his kingdom, and to reign in the midſt of his enemies, and to break them in peices as a potters veſſel, Pſal.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26. 27. And his <hi>being admired at, by and in them that believe, when they ſee his glory,</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 18. As the diſciples, that our Lord told of the ſufferings he was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh at <hi>Jeruſalem, Luk.</hi> 18. 31. to 34. It is ſayd, <hi>they underſtood none of thoſe things; and thoſe ſayings were hid from them:</hi> ſo in
<pb facs="tcp:106759:4"/> like manner, ſpeak now of the great things that will take place when the Lord Chriſt ſhall come again, in his glory, and they underſtand none of theſe things; and theſe things are hid from them: and they underſtand nothing, but Chriſt our Lord his coming to judgement; and that they ſeem to minde as a tranſcient thing, and not a ſet, ſolemn, and formal thing; a real judicature; and incline to think, it will be in heaven rather then here below on earth: ſpeaking as if they thought that the Lord Chriſt will but come to the Clouds, and then return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to heaven. Thus as the former notion concerning the world to come, ſo theſe in their notions, do make inſignificant much of the holy Scriptures, as if written in vain, unleſſe allegorized, or making them ſpeak out ſome ſpiritual meaning, which is put upon them; with the which, ſome pleaſe and content themſelves, without further enquiry or looking out after our Lords coming, and the good things that ſhall attend the ſame; otherwiſe then heaven above, as is ſaid before. Whereas, if the Scriptures be well minded and conſidered, it will plainly appear, that many, if not moſt of the exhortations in the new teſtament, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to repent, to add to faith vertue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To grow in grace,</hi> and ſo all other duties towards God, and man; are, from the conſideration, of the great glory and happineſs, that is to be brought to, and enjoyed by the ſaints, at the fore mentioned, glorious coming and kingdom of Chriſt, here upon earth; and not ſo much from the conſideration of the glory of heaven above; ſave only as it is in the laſt place comprehended therein, and to be enjoyed by them, to wit, after the laſt judgement here upon the earth is ended, and <hi>our Lord Chriſt hath delivered up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to God the father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are yet other hindrances, of which briefly. Some ſay, it is a controverſie, and they do not care to meddle with controverſies: what doth this ſignifie? at our Lords firſt coming, it was a controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, <hi>whether he was the Chriſt or no?</hi> ſome ſaid, <hi>he was;</hi> others denied it, and ſaid <hi>he was a deceiver,</hi> and thoſe deceived, that did own him; <hi>have any of the rulers, or phariſes belived on him? but this people who know not the law, are curſed. Joh.</hi> 7. 48. 49. <hi>John</hi> ſent to him to know, <hi>art thou he that ſhould come? or do we look for another?</hi> Indeed, ſo great a thing, and of ſo high concernment, as the coming of the Saviour, vailed, and ſo much oppoſed; ſhould make men to ſearch, and ſeek into it the more, leſt haply they be found at a loſſe when be comes.</p>
                  <p>And yet further, ſome ſay and upon that account look not after it, but
<pb facs="tcp:106759:4"/> let it alone: namely, That the ancient fathers, and ſome add, the modern Divines, were not for it, but rather againſt our Lord Chriſt his coming, to ſet up his kingdom and reign here on earth: this is taken for granted, though very queſtionable, and not likely to be true; which if it were, what doth it ſignifie? little or nothing at all: the high Preiſt, and elders were againſt Chriſt, and the Goſpel; <hi>do any of the Prieſts, or rulers believe on him?</hi> They did not then, and if they do not now or have not done what doth it avail?</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding all before ſaid, of the obſtructions, the knowledge of it increaſeth, and is very likely ſo to do; till that be made good, <hi>that the Goſpel of the kingdom,</hi> [and coming again of the Lord Chriſt to reign] <hi>be preached to all nations, then ſhall the end come, Math.</hi> 24. 14. great things will attend that great day: and though now it is dark and hidden, it will come to be preached on the houſe top, and received and entertained more and more; as it begins to be, being as the preſent truth of the day, and that which is much on the ſpirits of many of the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, who look for the return of their Lord, and are in great expectation, like good old <hi>Simeon who waited for the conſolation of Iſrael, and was glad,</hi> and greatly ſatisfied, when he had ſeen the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: as thoſe bleſſed expectants now will be with the ſignes of his coming: and much more <hi>when they ſhall ſee him come in the clouds of heaven; when they will be changed in a moment, and caught up to meet him, when he cometh, when he cometh; Fully to take unto him his great power, and to reign: at which, the nations will then be fully angry, Rev.</hi> 11. 17. 18. <hi>when he cometh to judge the world in righteouſneſs, and the people with his truth, Pſal.</hi> 96. 13. <hi>when he cometh to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in, and by all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> 2. Theſſ. 1. 10. <hi>when he cometh in flaming fire, to render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, &amp;c.</hi> as in <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>when he cometh to make inquiſition for blood, Pſal.</hi> 9. 12. to wit, <hi>the blood of the righteous,</hi> from <hi>Abel,</hi> to that day, ſhed by cruel and envious ones, and wicked oppreſſers on the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 24. that cry, will be a ſad tone to the wicked, and will make them ſhake and tremble; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 13. <hi>for he cometh for he cometh to judge the world with righteouſneſs</hi> &amp;c. as on the other hand, it will be gladſom to the Saints; they may lift up their heads and hearts with joy: for their redeemer, their redemption and full bleſſedneſs is at the very door.</p>
                  <p>If theſe propoſalls, and eſſays come into the hands of the learned, their favourable cenſure is deſired, and that they would overlook any failer if
<pb facs="tcp:106759:5"/> in want of art and well dreſſing the matter; or over often mentioning of of things, called tautologie, which could not well be avoided, the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Chriſt his kingdom and coming having ſo many great things and various attending of them. And beſides, thoſe for whom this principally was intended, and made common, may not have that acuteneſs; but what they may want that way; they have in love and affection, in zeal and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to receive and embrace the truth at all times. In the time of our Lord Chriſts being here, they owned him; <hi>the poor, then, received the Goſpel;</hi> when thoſe of higher rank ſtood at a diſtance, and rather made oppoſition. The Apoſtles were men of low rank; fiſher-men, and the like; yea, the women were very forward in the then owning our Lord Chriſt, and great lovers of him; and ſuch as our Lord Chriſt being riſen, firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto; and made them meſſengers to the Apoſtles, to inform them of that great truth, <hi>of his being riſen again from the dead:</hi> his way is ſo, to make men humble, that they might learn not to diſpiſe the day of ſmall beginnings or things. Conſult the holy hiſtories, and the hiſtories down, and ſince: the histories of <hi>France, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and others; and it is likely, as it hath been ſo; it will be found ſtill; not but that ſometimes God annoints perſons of higher rank, and maketh known his mind unto them, and makes uſe of them; but it ſeemeth not to be his ordinary method, but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>If any advantage by the things propoſed come to any, either for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of their knowledge, or their being encouraged to believe, hope, and wait for their fulfilling; the propoſer of them, will think himſelf well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paied: read, and conſider well of what thou readest; nothing is impoſed on thee: <hi>try all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great doctrine of the reſurrection of the dead, was a thing, that holy <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Apoſtle of the gentiles, had a great inſight into, as he had alſo, in many other high myſteries which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and made known unto him; the which he imparted, for the benefit and profit of others. That truth looking forward, eyeing a future time, when it ſhall be made good; but in all times neceſſary to be made known and believed, by all the ſervants of God, whoſe hope is not in this world.</p>
                     <p>This, <hi>of riſing again</hi> after death, in his proceed on that ſubject; he begins with that, of the Lord Chriſt his being riſen; of the truth whereof were many witneſſes, as is mentioned by him; he taking knowledge of ſome amongſt themſelves, that ſaid, <hi>there was to be no reſurrection from the dead,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. contrary to the faith that was preached and beleeved: and being a thing, that did render the aſſertors of that truth, as falſe witneſſes; which he makes good, from the tiſing from death, the Lord Chriſt; laying very great ſtreſſe on that, as a foundation and bottom, on which the whole building ſtands; he mentions it again, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and argues from thence, to the 20th. <hi>verſe,</hi> to make out, and clear that truth; and then in <hi>vers.</hi> 20. he concludes ſaying; but <hi>now is Chriſt riſen, and become the firſt fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> (ſo he calleth death).</p>
                     <p>This doctrine of the reſurrection, looketh backward, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: as it looketh backward, it eyeth death which came by man, to wit, <hi>Adam:</hi> as it looketh forward, it eyeth living again by man, to wit, the man Chriſt, our Lord, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 21. He is the bleſſed redeemer from the grave, and the reſtorer to life again, after death.</p>

                        </q> this; It looketh backward, and forward: backward, It eyeth <hi>Adam:</hi> forward it relateth to the Lord Chriſt, the new and ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> as by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin entred, and death by ſin, as the effect follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its cauſe: <hi>Adam</hi> was forewarned and it was told him in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> that <hi>in the day he did eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evel, he ſhould die:</hi> he did notwithſtanding take and eat; he ſinned, and death ſeized on him; by ſin came death, and it went over all. <hi>Adam</hi> being the father of all, the ſtock from whence man proceeded; his ſin, or ſin that entred by his diſobedience, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and entailed to all his poſteritie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>As by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. By one mans offence, death reigned by one. In <hi>Adam</hi> all ſin; In <hi>Adam</hi> all die.</p>
                     <p>In the Lord Chriſt, <hi>all ſhall be made alive;</hi> the juſt, and the unjuſt; the righteous, and the wicked: all, over whom death hath reigned; all, that dyed in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo is the paralel and proportion; <hi>as,</hi> and <hi>ſo:</hi> all, ſhall be made alive, by the power of the Lord Chriſt, the great conqueror of ſin, and death.</p>
                     <p>The matter is conſiderable, as it relateth to the reſurrection, and riſing again of the ſons of <hi>Adam;</hi> the argument, or thing, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was upon; and it doth not meddle with that, of election, and faith; or living by faith in a ſpiritual way; neither may it be ſo underſtood or made uſe of, without ſtraining, and forcing it to ſpeak that the Apoſtle never intended. <hi>In Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> ſo as to riſe and live again in the body. There ſhall be a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, of the juſt, and of the unjuſt: ſome ſhall be made alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to everlaſting life, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2.

                     <p>
                        <hi>As by man,</hi> [to wit, <hi>Adam]</hi> came death: ſo <hi>by man:</hi> [namely, the Lord Jeſus, very man, and the ſon of man, ſo he ſtiles himſelf] <hi>came alſo the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> By the firſt man, <hi>Adam,</hi> came death: by the ſecond man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, came the reſurrection from death. Alas for thoſe <hi>ſadduces!</hi> that ſay, <hi>there is no reſurrection.</hi> It is good for all the ſervants of God, and lovers of the Lord Chriſt, to be of like confeſſion and belief with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts.</hi> 24. 15. And have hope towards God, that there ſhall be a reſurrection from the dead, both of the juſt, and the unjuſt. The power and vertue of the reſurrection of the Lord Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth great effects; as to the one; ſo to the other.</p>
                     <p>The forementioned words, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all die; ſo, in Chriſt, ſhall all be made a live,</hi> are ſo full and plain, as nothing can be ſaid further; there needs no dilating on them, only keep to the thing in hand, to wit, death or dying: and riſing and living again after it. As to that, of all dying in <hi>Adam;</hi> ask the many ages and generations that are paſt, ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> ſince God created man upon the earth; ask what is become of the great potentates, the mighty men, the rich, the wiſe, the honorable, yea, the good, and juſt men alſo; and all free, and bond; and they will all beare witneſs in a real wiſe to this; that in <hi>Adam all die:</hi> they are all dead and gone; they are all in their graves, death hath gone over all; as ſin went before, ſo death followed after: all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> as well
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106759:8"/> as he himſelf, have dyed; only, two, or three excepted, that dyed not, but were tranſlated,</p>
                     <p>In like manner, and in way of parallel and proportion: In Chriſt, and by Chriſt, ſhall all be made alive: ſooner or later; not one of <hi>Adams</hi> ſons excepted; there is no reſerve in the caſe: <hi>all muſt ariſe;</hi> all muſt appeare and <hi>give an account of the things they have done in the fleſh, whether good, or evil,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. all muſt be judged, and be either acquited, or elſe condemned; the whole race and poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom all dyed.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>BUt now to prevent miſtakes; leſt any ſhould think, that all ſhall riſe together (to wit, the juſt, and unjuſt) &amp; to give information touching the thing in hand: the Apoſtle diſcovereth a great thing, of which very little had been declared before in the holy Scripture, though much had been ſaid touching the reſurrection; he in <hi>vers.</hi> 23. tells of an order, in which all theſe ſhall riſe: but every man in his own order.</p>
                     <p>This order, is very conſiderable; a great thing, a great diſcovery: firſt, in regard of the perſons riſing; ſecondly, in regard of the time, when they ſhall riſe; for all ſhall not riſe at one and the ſame time, and together: but every one in his own time, according to order; it is by the Apoſtle laid down thus; firſt, Chriſt the Lord; that was over and paſt: then thoſe that are Chriſts, <hi>[when?]</hi> at his coming: that's their turn or order; and alſo is the time of their judgment, blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of their ſins, pronouncing them bleſſed and holy, and their inheriting the kingdom. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 34. Then, after the thouſand years Reign is ended, in the interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and coming of the end, to wit, of his kingdom and his delivering of it up to God the father, the unjuſt ſhall ariſe to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that's their turn or order, and the time of their judgment; for they ſhall not live again untill the end of the thouſand years. <hi>Rev.</hi> 23. 5. and then ſhall be the reſurrection and judgment of the unjuſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. 13. of which more hereafter.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106759:8"/>
                     <p>An order there is, and will be; ſo the Apoſtle hath declared: but every man in his own order: they ſhall ariſe, and ſtand forth; as it was ſaid to <hi>Daniell, thou ſhalt ſtand up in thy lot</hi> [or order] <hi>at the end of the days, Dan.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in Glory. Col.</hi> 3. 4. that's our lot or order.</p>
                     <p>Touching this of order, our Lord Chriſt was the firſt, the leading, and preheminence; it did belong to him: <hi>he aroſe</hi> and <hi>was the firſt fruits of thoſe that roſe from ſleep,</hi> ſo in <hi>vers.</hi> 20. of this 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>He did riſe again according te the Scriptures:</hi> Two Angells told the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that prepared ſpices and oyntment and went to the Sepulchre to look for him; <hi>He is not here, but is riſen. Luk.</hi> 24. 6. 7. being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, <hi>he was ſeen of</hi> many; firſt, <hi>of the women,</hi> then <hi>of Peter,</hi> after <hi>of the two Diſciples going to Emaus, Luk.</hi> 24. he was <hi>ſeen of five hundred brethren at once;</hi> then of <hi>James,</hi> then of <hi>all the Apoſtles,</hi> after of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5. to 8. who though he ſpake low of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was a high, a great witneſſe and aſſerter of this truth, of Chriſt being riſen. It is a part of the Goſpel; a great truth, Preached, and witneſſed, by many faithfull witneſſes, and accordingly believed by the ſervants of God in the ages ſince, to this day: and were it not ſo; the ſervants of God, and more eſpecially the Martyrs and great ſufferers for Chriſt, <hi>were of all men the moſt miſerable:</hi> but <hi>Chriſt is riſen, and is the firſt fruits of them that riſe,</hi> and it was his order.</p>
                     <p>The next order, or lot, declared by the Apoſtle, it is to the juſt, as it is ſaid; <hi>afterwards they that are Chriſts:</hi> they ſhall be raiſed, and ſhall enjoy the redemption of the body from the power of the grave; it ſhall no longer have dominion over them: they ſhall come forth to the reſurrection and judgment of life; and as in the firſt place it relates to them, is the true underſtanding of what is ſpoken on that account, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
                     <p>So ſure as Chriſt, the Lord, is riſen and aſcended; ſo ſurely ſhall they riſe, in their order, and time: they, with <hi>Daniell,</hi> ſhall ſtand up in their lott together; all the ſervants of God that have fallen aſleep in the ſeveral ages of the world, and have for a long time ſlept in Jeſus; they ſhall awake, ariſe and meet the Lord when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 14. 16. 17. <hi>God that raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, will raiſe us up alſo by Jeſus.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 14. he will raiſe us by his own power, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. and an exceeding great and mighty power; it is worthy our knowledge, and our deſire to know, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. 20.</p>

                        <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt:</hi> it is their order, their lot, next after the Lord Chriſt. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. the Lord Chriſt is riſen, and aſcended, ſitteth at the right hand of God; it is now ſixteen hundred &amp; ſeventy four years ſince: he will come again to them that look for him, <hi>he will appear</hi> the ſecond time, <hi>without ſin unto ſalvation, Heb.</hi> 9. 28. and then, at his coming, ſhall their order and turn be: <hi>when the Lord Jeſus ſhall deſcend from heaven, with a ſhout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. at his coming, the Apoſtle tells us it will be: two great things will then concur, and be together: Chriſt, our Lord, his coming, and the righteous their riſing again, and meeting with him.</p>
                     <p>The next order or lott, is to the wicked, or unjuſt; of which the Apoſtle ſaith little; only: <hi>then cometh the end:</hi> not hereby meaning, that Chriſts kingdom would be at an end, and delivered up to God the father, preſently upon his coming, and raiſing the juſt; for there are many, and great things to be done before; he therefore therein ſecretly comprehends and includes the reſurrection of the unjuſt, to wit, between the reſurrection of the juſt, and coming of the end of his kingdom, when he is to deliver it up, and before the ſame: then ſhall the unjuſt ariſe in their order, and turn; a thouſand years after the riſing of the juſt: touching whom it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>and they lived, and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years. vers.</hi> 5. <hi>but the reſt of the dead</hi> [to wit the unjuſt or wicked dead], <hi>they lived not again, untill the thouſand years were finiſhed.</hi> In the bleſſed morning of the reſurrection, the juſt will have the dominion, they will have the preheminence then, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 14.</p>
                     <p>A riſing again of the unjuſt there will be; ſo the Scripture holdeth forth: it was the confeſſion and belief of holy <hi>Paul, Acts.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>and have hope towards God,</hi> that there ſhall be a reſurrection, both of the juſt, and unjuſt. But as to the time, or order, of raiſing the unjuſt, he ſaith no more, but <hi>then cometh the end,</hi> ſtrongly imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that towards the end of Chriſts kingdom, and before he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it up, they alſo ſhall ariſe, and come to judgment: Chriſt our Lord the firſt fruits: <hi>then,</hi> a long time ſince: [not yet come] after, thoſe that are Chriſts; expreſly declared to be, at his coming: <hi>then cometh the end:</hi> implying as before; neer that time they ſhall ariſe, and not before: towards the end; a little before the laſt ſeſſion; neer a thouſand years after the riſing of the juſt; as before.</p>

                        <hi>Then cometh the end;</hi> the end of time, or of a ſtate: it may be conſidered as in a more General way, as holding out the latter end of a ſtate, or of time; as a day, year, or years neer accompliſhed, is ſaid, to be the end of that day, year, or years: as was ſaid by the Lord himſelf to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6 13. <hi>the end of all fleſb is come, &amp;c.</hi> It is at hand; It is but a little while, and the floud will come and ſweep away all; it only ſtays while <hi>Noah</hi> builds the Ark; but the end was come.</p>
                     <p>Yet further, when the floud was come; all were not drowned preſently; haply, ſome might live twenty, thirty, or forty days after the floud was come and begun: and it is ſaid, <hi>that the end of all fleſh was come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſecondly; the end, may be taken ſtrictly, for the utter end of time, or being of a thing; as the utter end of a day, year, or years; the filling, or full finiſhing thereof: nothing remaining; an end, an utter end. According to ſuch an end, as was come upon the old world, when the floud was at hand; ſo it may be minded and taken here, as in order to the riſing of the unjuſt and wicked to judgment: towards the end of Chriſts kingdom; and reign on earth, a little before he reſigns: before the utter end be come; ſhall the riſing of the unjuſt, and wicked, be to judgment. And as, in the laſt place, it relates to them, is the true underſtanding of what is ſpoken on that account, in <hi>John</hi> 5. 28. 29. for ſutable to the ſeveral reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both of the juſt, and unjuſt; ſo alſo is their judgment to be; and alſo what is ſpoken, in <hi>Math.</hi> 25 34. concerning the judgment and ſalvation of the juſt; and in <hi>vers</hi> 41. of the judgment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the unjuſt, is thus to be underſtood, and will be found to be truth, in the day thereof.</p>

                     <p>THe Apoſtle in his proceed, ſeemeth to make a digreſſion from the matter in hand, namely, <hi>the reſurrection;</hi> which he returns unto, and ſpeaks largely of, afterward: but here, having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>the coming of the end:</hi> he falls on: ſpeaking of very high, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106759:10"/> great things that ſhall attend the end, in order to our Lord Chriſt his kingdom and reign: and having put down all enemies; his then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering up his kingdom; and God the father becoming all in all; he waves the mentioning of the reſurrection of the unjuſt, and ſpeaks no otherwiſe then thus; <hi>then cometh the end;</hi> and ſo takes on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that ſhall be at the end alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 24, <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all Authority, and power;</hi> that which is firſt ſet down, is the laſt thing that will be done at the utmoſt end, when all things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the reign and dominion are finiſhed; then he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to God the father: when all power and authorities are put down, all enemies under his feet; <hi>then</hi> he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to God the father, of whom he received it. <hi>Then</hi> all that are under our Lord Chriſt, <hi>then,</hi> ſhall give up their power alſo: and God the father ſhall be all, in all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When he ſhall have put down all rule, and authority, and power.</hi> Great kings and monarchs, uſe to have all rule, authority, and power, derived from them by all that are under them; and what they meet with in their dominions that is not ſo derived, they put down and ſuppreſſe. Our Lord Chriſt, a mighty king and monarch: <hi>then;</hi> will do in like manner; put down all rule and authority, not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, all that make oppoſition; his enemies that would not have him reign over them; that will not ſubject themſelves: the princes, and rulers of the unſaved Nations, <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> and the captains and mighty men, with all that excerciſe rule and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; they will then, by our Lord Chriſt, he utterly diſpoſſeſſed of their power, and put down. The prophecy of <hi>Malachi</hi> will, <hi>then;</hi> in the reign of our Lord Chriſt, be made good to the life; <hi>they ſhall be ſo burnt up, as there ſhall be left, neither root, nor branch:</hi> there will be none to ſucceed them, to take their dominions and thrones after them; as now, the ſon ſucceeding the father: but it will not be ſo <hi>then;</hi> their places will be no more ſound, for ever.</p>
                     <p>All authoritie, and power, and rule, in the time of the kingdom and reign of our Lord Jeſus, in the thouſand yeers, he will ſubject: and put down all, that have enmity in them; ſooner or later, he will put them under his feet. This is one of the great things to be done, before the utter end come: the putting down all rule, authoritie, and power, in an active, viſible way: and until then; he muſt reign, and his kingdome continue: for ſo it is ſaid, expreſly, in <hi>vers.</hi> 25.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106759:10"/> 
                        <hi>He muſt reign, until he</hi> [himſelf] <hi>hath put all his enemies under his feet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All his enemies:</hi> great and ſmall, high, and low, one, and all; by what name, or title ſoever they be named, or called; he ſhall ſubdue them; and as a mighty, mighty Monarch, ſhall ſubject them under his feet, and put them down: all that have enmity in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and the <hi>grave;</hi> they ſhall all be deſtroyed by him: <hi>the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, will be death,</hi> as after is expreſt; the Apoſtle layes great ſtreſſe upon it; <hi>he muſt, he muſt reign, until then.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>until</hi> ſeemeth not to be the ſame, with that in the 110. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> mentioned by our Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 44. Alſo by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footſtool:</hi> Which ſcriptures ſome urge, againſt the perſonal coming of our Lord Chriſt the ſecond time, and his reigning here, on earth: ſaying thus: he muſt ſtay in heaven, until <hi>all be done here; his enemies made his footſtool:</hi> So, as if all the ſcriptures, that ſpeak of his kingdome and reign, ſhall be made good in a virtual way, and that's all. To dilate the matter a little.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that in the 110. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the other alledged ſcriptures; is done by God the father himſelf: he ſaid to the ſon, the Lord Chriſt; as thoſe places do ſhew: but this is done by the Lord Chriſt, himſelf; <hi>he muſt reign, until he hath made,</hi> &amp;c. Again, that's done by God the father, in heaven: this, is done by the Lord Chriſt, himſelf, on earth. That's done by the father, in heaven, where the Lord Chriſt is ſitting, at his right hand; This, is done by the Lord Chriſt, he reigning on earth, and being come the ſecond time unto the earth, and having taken to himſelf his great power, and reign, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 17. And he muſt reign, <hi>till his enemies be made his footſtool.</hi> That's, but enemies, in a general way of expreſſion; and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to, and be meant, only, of ſome enemies: but this, here; is of <hi>all enemies;</hi> even the laſt, even death it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>That of the 110. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſeemeth to be an inveſting of the Lord Chriſt with power, and a deligating to him, ſoveraigntie or rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all things, in heaven, and earth; as it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, authorities, and powers, being made ſubject unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this of the Apoſtle, here, is of acting, and exerciſing that power; and putting it in execution; putting down, and under him, all rule, authoritie, and power, and his enemies under his feet actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106759:11"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, That in the 110 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſo often mentioned in the holy ſcriptures; is of a prophetical, promiſary nature, and was made good unto our Lord Chriſt, by God the father, when he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his ſo low humiliation: then, and therefore, <hi>God hath high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted him, and given him a name, above every name, Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. <hi>That at the name</hi> [to wit, the ſoveraigntie, and power] <hi>of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow; of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth: and that every tongue ſhould confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord,</hi> to the glory of God the father: that ſo highly exalted Jeſus, our Lord. He is exalted, far above all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallitie, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name, that is named [to wit, of dignity, honor, and power]: he hath a name above all; whether in this world, or that which is to come; <hi>and hath put all things under his feet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 21. 22. God the father, hath advanced our Lord Jeſus above them all; and put all things under his feet. Our Lord Chriſt, he is above; above them all, higher, and greater; and over them all; And they, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and under his feet: the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, <hi>he is gone into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and is on the right hand of God: Angels, and authorities, and powers, being made ſubject to him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                     <p>So, as upon the whole, to ſay no more; there is no need of our Lord his ſtay in heaven upon that account; his enemies not being made his footſtool and ſubjected under him: that being done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; he need not ſtay but to the appointed time. As in the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, or the fullneſs of time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. he came before, in the ſtate of humiliation: ſo he will in the appointed time, come the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, in power, and great glory: then he will take unto him his great power, and rule in the middeſt of his enemies: when he taketh to him his great power and reign; then all nations ſhall ſerve, and obey him, and all kings ſhall fall down before him, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 72. 11.</p>
                     <p>And his kingdom and reign, ſhall be outward, and viſible on earth: (as his converſe and humiliation, was, in the days of his being here on earth): when he ſhall come the ſecond time, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and great glory. The holy Apoſtle, ſeemeth fully to ſpeak unto, that, before declared, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet;</hi> for in that he put all things under him, he left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not put in ſubjection under him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſoveraignty, and greatneſs of power; ſo he is highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced over all.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106759:11"/>
                     <p>But according to his dominion, kingdom, and reign, he hath not entred upon it yet; he hath not yet taken unto him his great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: he hath not yet, ſubjected and put down, all rule, authority, and power, as the Apoſtle tells us; and we may ſay, as he ſaid: we ſee not yet all things put under him. When he comes, he muſt reign till he hath put them under his feet; even death; that great, and laſt enemie to be deſtroyed; as then when the Apoſtle did write; he did not then ſee all things ſubdued under him: ſo now, we may ſay; the great, and oppoſite powers, and rulers, they remain in dignity and power. The Ethnick, and Infidell Monarchs and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, the Mahumetans, the antichriſtians; do yet keep up their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: with other enemies, not a few. And ſin, and the laſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my death; all theſe remaining; doth ſpeak out this fully, we ſee not yet all things put under him, the Lord Chriſt. Though we ſee the Lord Chriſt, that was made low by the ſuffering of death, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced, and crowned with honour, and glory; in which, the promiſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 110. which is prophetical is fully made good by the father, and as before was ſaid, is no lett of his coming the ſecond time, till his enemies be made his footſtool firſt.</p>
                     <p>So, as that <hi>untill Pſalm.</hi> 110. and the reſt; differ from this <hi>untill,</hi> the one, relating to the time, of his taking upon him his great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and reign as a mighty monarch here on earth; unto whom all ſhall ſtoop, ſerve and obey: and till then, he muſt reign; even till death, it ſelf, the laſt enemy, be conquered, ſubdued, and deſtroyed, by him that mighty conquerer, that ſhall cauſe death to be ſwallowed up in victory, <hi>vers.</hi> 54. that triumphing may be made; <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? vers.</hi> 55. and thanks given to God for the ſame, <hi>vers</hi> 57. <hi>thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> that great and mighty conqueror.</p>
                     <p>Further, there will be enemies in the time of Chriſt our Lord his reign on earth, which he muſt ſubdue and put down: all rule, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and power, wherein there is enmity; <hi>gog</hi> and <hi>magog,</hi> with all their confederates, and company; whoſe numbers will be as the ſand of the ſea, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 8. and theſe enemies: muſt, by him, be all deſtroyed, before the end of Chriſt our Lord, his kingdom and reign: for that death, alſo, that laſt enemy, muſt likewiſe be deſtroyed, as it is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14. and <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>hell,</hi> (or the grave) <hi>were caſt into the lake of fire: gog,</hi> and <hi>magog,</hi> and all other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106759:12"/> enemies, muſt be firſt deſtroyed; for that <hi>the laſt enemy that is to be deſtroyed, is death.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 26. <hi>The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death:</hi> of death being the laſt enemy; ſomthing hath by occaſion been often ſaid, it ſhall therefore be waved here: but death, as an enemy: we ſhall minde a little. Death; it is an old, and common enemie, an enemie to all the ſons of <hi>Adam:</hi> an enemy to the Lord Chriſt himſelf; an enemy to thoſe that are Chriſts; to the promiſed ſeed: few have eſcaped him: death as an enemy, it ſeized on the Lord Chriſt, and had power over him; but could not keep it: for it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 24. He tryumphed over it on the Croſs; and by death, overcame him that had the power of death. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                     <p>Enemies there will be in the time of the reign of our Lord Chriſt, to be put down, and to be deſtroyed by him; but the laſt enemie, to be deſtroyed, will be death. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14. it is ſaid; death &amp; hell, [or the grave] were caſt into the lake of fire; and then preſently, followeth the end of Chriſt his kingdom and reign here on earth, and a delivering up all to God the father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 27. <hi>For he hath put all things under his feet: he</hi> to wit, God the father, hath ſo put all things under the feet of our Lord Chriſt. He hath highly advanced him over all: <hi>far above all principalities, and powers and mights, and dominions;</hi> and <hi>every name, that is named,</hi> to wit, of power and dignities: all; God the father put under the feet of Chriſt, as before, is more largly held forth.</p>
                     <p>But here the Apoſtle comes in with a caution, or reſerve: for God the father, in putting all things under him (namely the ſon) he did not ſubject or put under himſelf: there's an exception in that; there's a <hi>but</hi> there; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but when he ſaith, <hi>all things are put under him,</hi> it is manifeſt, he is excepted: he is not meant or intended; he is not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this, <hi>all things;</hi> but the contrary: God, that put all things under; it is manifeſt he is excepted; ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>that did put all things under him;</hi> the ſum of all ſeemeth to be this; that God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the high advance of the Lord Chriſt; did not ſubject or make lower himſelf: for (ſaith the Apoſtle) it is manifeſt, he is excepted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 28. He goeth on further; ſaying, <hi>and when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him:</hi> (by the way; the words, ſubduing, ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106759:12"/> putting under, putting under feet; are all of like import, and tendenoy): when the Lord Chriſt in the time of his reign, hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and actually put down all authority and power; when all enemies are put under his feet, and the laſt enemy death deſtroyed, (for till then, he muſt reign); then ſhall the ſon, himſelf, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him (namely the father) that put all things under him, that God may be all, in all. When the Lord Chriſt, that great, and mighty monarch; king of kings, and Lord of Lords, ſhall have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his reign, and done what he had to do, here on earth, then ſhall he deliver up the kingdom to the father, of whom he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: God the father, that ſo highly advanced him; and put all things under him, ſhall have all ſurrendred and delivered up to him, and be all, in all. An end, a final end of that happy kingdom of our Lord Chriſt here on earth, and of our living, and reigning with him therein a 1000 years: <hi>and all the time of the laſt Seſſion of judgment following the ſame, which is the laſt and moſt glorious adminiſtration of his kingdom, and as worthy Mr.</hi> Archer <hi>apprehends, will laſt neer a thouſand years more, which I leave to the day to declare, all which is comprehended in Chriſt's and the Saints reigning together therein, though not ſo particularly expreſſed:</hi> and alſo a mentioning of one to ſucceed; to wit, the kingdom of the father.

                     <p>TO dilate a little concerning the beginning, and end, of the kingdom of our Lord Chriſt, ſo often mentioned to be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years: the beginning, and end, have a <hi>medium,</hi> or middle time to make up the whole; ſo as to ſuppoſe, if a hundred, or if fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years be reckoned to the beginning, in a general way; and a like number to the end; then the middle or body of the time, will be eight or nine hundred years: the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the beginning, at our Lord Chriſt, his coming; when will be alſo the reſurrection of the juſt (mentioned <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 14.) he mentions the end; when the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106759:13"/> Lord hath reigned his time, and done or finiſhed his reign what he had to do therein; and had received that honour he was to have done him on earth; he ſaith, <hi>then cometh the end:</hi> but he ſpeaks lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle expreſly, touching the middle time, and what ſhall be done therein; only incluſively, he ſaith, <hi>he muſt reign, till the end;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he hath put down all rule, authority, and power; <hi>till his enemies be made his footſtool,</hi> and death, the laſt enemy, deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>But as to the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and likewiſe, as to the <hi>end;</hi> he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of very high, and great things, that will fall in with, and be done in, both the one, and the other; of which we ſhall dilate a little; and firſt, of the things that concur with the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, then will be the coming of the Lord Chriſt, in the glory of his father, and of all the holy Angells, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 31. then; <hi>when he appeareth, we ſhall appear with him in glory: Col.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory:</hi> then will he fit on the throne of his glory; and before him, will both the good, and the bad, the ſaved, and the unſaved nations, that are then living, be gathered: the righteous will have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, <hi>then,</hi> they will be ſet on the right hand, <hi>vers.</hi> 33. then will be the reſurrection of the juſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 14. to live again, and to reign with the Lord Chriſt a thouſand years upon the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. (no mention is made of the wicked dead riſing at that time): then, will be, the redemption of the body, and an entertaining again of the ſoul, or ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. A great thing, a high miſterie: then will actually be made good, that great miſterie, the holy Apoſtle hath told us of, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye; and be caught up with the raiſed ſaints to meet the Lord Chriſt together,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 14. 17. Then, will be the time of our being unclothed, and clothed upon: <hi>when corruption, ſhall put on incorruption, and mortallitie, put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. <hi>Then, ſhall be the refreſhing, from the preſence of the Lord, and the reſtitution, or reſtoration of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began, Acts.</hi> 3. 19. 20, 21. Then, ſhall the <hi>new heavens, and the new earth</hi> wherein righteouſneſs will dwell, take place, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe of God the father 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. Then, will the <hi>new Jeruſalem come down from heaven,</hi> and the bride, the lambs wife, be richly adorned, and exceeding glorious. Then, will be alſo the mariage ſupper of the lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. 10. Then ſhall all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106759:13"/> things be made new, as at the beginning. (For theſe ſayings, are faithful, and true, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 6.) then, God ſhall wipe away all teares from the eyes of his: then, will no more be death, nor ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, nor pain there, to the ſervants of God for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 4. Then, ſhall ſathan be bound, or chained, that he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the ſaved nations in their great felicity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. To ſay no more, although much more might be mentioned relating to the beginning, and firſt coming of the Lord Chriſt into the kingdom, and reign, on earth.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall, in the next place, take notice of ſome things relating to, and contemporizing with, the end. Firſt of all, <hi>ſoon after the end of the thouſand years reign, and</hi> ſome ſhort time before the laſt ſeſſion of judgement beginneth, will ſathan be let looſe for a little ſeaſon, and will deceive the unſaved <hi>of the nations, who had been chained up with him till then,</hi> to <hi>their total ruine and deſtruction;</hi> then will <hi>Gag,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and their number, as the ſand of the ſea, gather together, and compaſſe the camp of the ſaints about, and the beloved city; then will fire come down from God out of heaven and deſtroy them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 7. 8. 9. Then ſhall the devil that deceived them, be caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, <hi>where the beaſt and falſe prophet (as being more wicked and abominable in the ſight of God then he) had been caſt, whileſt alive, above a thouſand years before, Rev.</hi> 20. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. <hi>Soon after,</hi> then will be the reſurrection of the unjuſt, and wicked ſinners; they ſhall, then, ariſe to judgment; for then, will be the ſecond, and laſt, great ſeſſion of judicature to that end, mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 11. 12. Then ſhall they be judged, condemned and caſt into the lake of fire, called the ſecond death. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. 13. 15. <hi>Which, as it is the laſt time, or concluding act, of the ſaints judging the world;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>So there being nothing, as to the time, mentioned before, and they being reſerved to the judgment of that great day and to be judged by the ſaints, ſo is it alſo the time of their judging of Angels.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Jude vers.</hi> 6. Then, the laſt enemie death, and hell, or the grave, ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14. Death, the laſt enemie will be then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. All enemies will, then, be totally ſubdued and deſtroyed, and put under his feet, actually, to the through fulfilling of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
                     <p>Then ſhall be an end of all rule, authoritie, and power, then will the Lord Chriſt deliver up the kingdom unto God the father, of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106759:14"/> whom he received it: then, will he become ſubject, himſelf, unto the father; and God, even the father, become all, in all: theſe are ſome of the great things that will attend the end.</p>
                     <p>We may, here, in a general way, a little take notice, what will be in the middle, or body of that time of the thouſand years of Chriſt his kingdom and reign on earth, according to what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hold forth, as to the great bleſſedneſs of the ſervants of God, and their long continuance in that happines, and high enjoyments for ever; once begun; ever continued. Thoſe great things mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as relating to the beginning, are not, many of them, to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded excluſively; but incluſively, as continuing to the very end. The things the righteous ſhall enjoy and be made partakers of; <hi>the eye hath not ſeen, the ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive.</hi> The pſalmiſt admires it (as may we) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>Oh how great is thy goodneſſe, which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee: which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee, before the ſons of men.</hi> It is ſaid, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Now are we the ſons of God</hi> [a great thing] <hi>and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be:</hi> [to wit, how happy, how bleſſed and glorious]: <hi>but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, and ſee him as he is.</hi> A great thing indeed. And we ſhall be for ever with him, and never ſevered from him more, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17. And <hi>in his preſence will be fulnes of joy, at his right hand, there are pleaſures for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. The holy ſcriptures of the old, and new teſtament, ſpeak much of the happines of that day to the righteous: in particular, holy <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> The pſalmiſt <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 72. 7. ſpeaking of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the tipe, but of our <hi>Solomon</hi> in the antitype; the Lord Jeſus ſayth, <hi>in his dayes</hi> [to wit in the time of his kingdom and reign], <hi>the righteous ſhall flouriſh; and abundance of peace,</hi> [ſhall be in the earth] <hi>ſo long as the Moon endureth.</hi> This will be, and continue, the whole thouſand years reign <hi>(and alſo all the time of the laſt ſeſſion of judgment, which, as hath been ſaid before, is the laſt and moſt glorious part and adminiſtration of Chriſts kingdom, and as ſome apprehend will laſt neer a thouſand years more,</hi> until he deliver up the kingdom to God the father and God the father become all, in all. That ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> at the end of the thouſand years <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 8. will be little, or none interruption thereunto, for it will be very ſhort, and is only to give the Lord an opportunity to deſtroy all the wicked that are left, in order to the ſpeedy reſurrection of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106759:14"/> whole, that had been dead, from <hi>Cain,</hi> to that time, to come to judgment, and is to uſher in the ſame; which kingdom of our Lord Chriſt, in all the parts and adminiſtrations thereof, being ended and delivered up by him to God the father, and God the father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all, in all; the Saints ſhall then receive and enjoy higher and greater glory, and ſhall go, and be with the Lord Chriſt for ever in the kingdom of the father; a particular ſetting down of things, we ſhall forbear, for fear of tiring the reader.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IN the next place, upon the whole of thoſe verſes forenamed, we may minde, the great wiſdom and underſtanding, that holy <hi>Paul</hi> was endued withall, the many revelations he had, and the high miſteries that were unfolded and made known unto him; which he hath declared for the good and benefit of others, being made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of God for that purpoſe. He had high diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and an abundance of revelations; and yet was kept humble; Gods grace being ſufficient. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. 9. holy <hi>Paul</hi> had much made known unto him, of very high and great ſecrets: he had a great inſight into the high miſteries of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 3. 4. they were declared by him: ſuch high miſteries, as are not declared and held forth, ſo particularly, by any other; as namely, the order that will be in the reſurrection, and when the juſt ſhall ariſe; in their order; and when the unjuſt. The reſurrection is a great thing; pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſpel: the order mentioned, is a great thing alſo, not ſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by any other: he hath declared unto us the concurrents of the reſurrection of the juſt, with Chriſt, our Lord, his firſt appearing: and likewiſe, he hath very plainly told us of the end of Chriſts kingdom, and reign. He hath given us ſome ſhort hints, but very plain, of another time, and ſtate, that will ſucceed that of Chriſts kingdom and reign on earth; namely, that of the kingdom of the father, when God the father, ſhall be all, in all. He hath ſhewed a great miſtery not mentioned, but by him <hi>vers</hi> 51. <hi>Behold, I ſhew you a miſtery; we ſhall not all ſleep: but we ſhall all be changed; in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106759:15"/> 
                        <hi>in the twinkling of an eye, &amp;c.</hi> to wit all thoſe Saints that ſhall be alive at the coming of the Lord Chriſt; he hath declared the mode, or manner of it; a great ſecret: <hi>this corruptible, ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortal, ſhall put on immortality,</hi> vers. 53. a bleſſed change: a putting off old clothing, and a putting on of new; very rich, and of great worth.</p>
                     <p>By him was declared the groaning of the creature by reaſon of the burdens they are under; with alſo their expectation of freedom from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. 21. 22. and how they ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
                     <p>Unto him, the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, it was revealed, that great miſtery, that was not known in former ages; but was hid in God from the beginning of the world. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 5. 9. The matter of which miſtery, was the taking on of the Gentiles; great ſtrangers and aliens, into oneneſſe, and fellowſhip with the Jews: making them <hi>fellow-citizens, and of the houſhold of God. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 19. that <hi>the Gentiles ſhould be fellow heirs, and of the ſame body, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel.</hi> And likewiſe, the rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jewes, the breaking of them off, and grafting the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles on the ſame ſtock, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. a very high matter; a great miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, holding forth very rich grace and mercy; at which, the Apoſtle very greatly admired, and cryed out, <hi>vers.</hi> 33. <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſedom, and knowledge of God,</hi> &amp;c!</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> was a man of great knowledge: he had viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and revelations. He had by a viſion made known to him, the breaking down of the partition-wall between the Jew, and the Gentle, <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. which, when he underſtood, he ſaid, in vers. 34. <hi>of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Paul</hi> had the full of the miſtery revealed unto him, as before is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>Peter</hi> had great inſight into that great thing; of the pouring out of the ſpirit, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. and of the holy ſpirit come down from heaven; which things [to wit, the great things of the Goſpel,] the Angels deſire to look into, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                     <p>He had made known unto him, the great burning of the world, that now is; and likewiſe <hi>the new heavens, and the new earth,</hi> that ſhall be, according to the Lords promiſe; wherein dwelleth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. 12. 13. Unto him was made known; <hi>the times of refreſhing that ſhall be, when God ſhall ſend again, Jeſus:</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106759:15"/> the times of the reſtitution [or reſtoration] of all things: <hi>which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Acts.</hi> 3. 19. 20. 21.</p>
                     <p>Bleſſed <hi>Stephen,</hi> the firſt martyr for Jeſus; he had wonderfull ſight, or viſion, <hi>Acts.</hi> 7. 55. 56. <hi>he ſaw heaven opened, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God,</hi> the which he declared, and was ſtoned for ſo doing, <hi>vers.</hi> 58. That good ſervant of Jeſus; holy <hi>John;</hi> he had viſions and revelations, great ſecrets and miſteries, declared unto him; for him to make known unto the Churches. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. his book beareth record hereof, and is ſtiled, <hi>the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which he ſent and ſignified by his Angel to his ſervant John.</hi> Wherein he hath declared many things that were to come; and ſome things concerning the reſurrection of the juſt, and the unjuſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. 5. 6. 12. 13. And the kingdom of Chriſt, and the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, and the Saints reigning with him therein, <hi>Rev</hi> 20. 4. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1. 2. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3. 4. 5. And the firſt, and laſt ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of judgement. <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 20. 4. 6. 11. 12. 13. Which are true and faithfull ſayings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 5</p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeemeth to have exceeded in the number, and nature of the things that were revealed to him, and declared by him: he had an abundance of revelations: and was the man that was taken up into paradiſe; into the third heaven, and heard unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words, not lawfull to be uttered to fallen mortalls: which he did not ſpeak of, till after fourteen years. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. 3. 4. He hath declared the manner, and order, and time, of the juſt; and unjuſt; their riſing again; very plainly, in expreſs words: firſt Chriſt; then thoſe that are Chriſts, at his coming. Only the juſt, that are Chriſts, are then to be raiſed, compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6. not the unjuſt, then: but in an after time, according as hath been mentioned before, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5. 13. Where do we find the like? He hath made known, likewiſe, the beginning, and, in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the end of the kingdom and reign of our Lord Chriſt, on earth: and the delivering up of the kingdom to God the father, and becoming ſubject himſelf. He hath given us ſome ſhort hints; but very full, and plain; of a ſtate ſucceeding: very glorious; where, and when, God the father, ſhall be all, in all: and that, we may further take knowledge of, from the cloſe of thoſe verſes; of which we ſhall dilate a little; by way of enquirie and eſſay.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ALL things that have a beginning, and are meaſured by time; they have had, and will have, an end; only the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that hath no beginning, nor end; but is from everlaſting, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; and is not meaſured by time. There are many ends men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in holy Scripture, of which we ſhall forbear the mentioning. This world, that now is, will have an end, and be deſtroyed by fire; as the world, before, was by water. When this world ſhall have an end; then will take place, and begin, the world, to come; when, will begin, and take place, that happy time and ſtate, of the kingdom and reign <hi>of our Lord Chriſt, on earth, for a thouſand years: and after that; all the time of the laſt ſeſſion of judgment, which as hath been mentioned before, ſome apprehend will laſt neer a thouſand years more:</hi> that alſo, will have an end; when, the Lord Chriſt ſhall deliver up the kingdom, to the father; that God, the father, may be all, in all; as our Apoſtle hath declared. A very high thing; a great ſecret, of which, the Scriptures ſeem moſt ſilent, and to ſay little; at leaſt, the underſtanding and inſight into this great miſtery, or ſecret, ſeemeth little, in this age; holy <hi>Paul</hi> hints ſomething, God ſhall be all, in all, then.</p>
                     <p>By way of aſſay, we ſhall propoſe to conſideration, ſome thing, that the holy Scripture ſeemeth to hold forth of that glorious ſtate, that ſhall ſucceed the ſurrender of the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt, unto God the father, that he may be all, in all.</p>
                     <p>That God may be all, in all; ſeemeth to have much comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it. What is not included in all? With reference to any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or thing: it ſeemeth to eye that before ſpoken, of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, rule, and power of the Lord Chriſt in his kingdom; and his giving of it up, when he had put down all rule, authority, and power whatſoever, and become ſubject, himſelf, unto the father, that gave him that power, and put all things under his feet: then will God the father be all, in all. No <hi>medium</hi> then; nor no deliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of power, or dominion, to any; ſeemeth to be, then: but God the father, to be all, in all, in power, rule, and dominion.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106759:16"/>
                     <p>This all, in all, ſeemeth a great thing, and to contain much: but not much, ſeemeth to be revealed; at leaſt, we underſtand little, for the preſent; but are much in the dark herein. More, it may be, is held forth in the Scriptures, then we as yet diſcern: that there ſhall be ſuch a time, and ſtate; when God ſhall be all, in all; ſhall have the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt delivered up to him, and the Lord Chriſt become ſubject to the Father, that he may be all, in all: that ſuch a ſtate, ſuch a kingdom, there ſhall be, after the kingdom of our Lord Chriſt is ended; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeemeth to hold forth, as is mentioned before; and ſomething there is, that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to look that way, and to import ſomething, of ſuch a ſtate, and kingdom, of God the father; as the laſt; and moſt glorious. By way of aſſay, we ſhall propoſe ſomething, and leave it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wiſe in heart. That there ſhall be ſuch a glorious ſtate, and kingdom of the father, exceeding in glory, the kingdom of our Lord Chriſt, wherein, as hath been ſaid, will be great glory, and is the glory that he requeſted his father, <hi>that thoſe that he had given him, might be with him, that they might behold his glory, Job.</hi> 17. 24. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. partake of his glory: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. be glorified together; which glory will be very great: but in the kingdom of the father, when God ſhall be all, in all; then there will be higher and greater glory.</p>

Then ſhall the righteous, ſhine as the Sunn; where? In the kingdom of their father. It ſeemeth to hold forth, that the father will have a kingdom, and that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will ſhine forth in glory, then: and there: of which we ſhall dilate a little. Our Lord, a little before; had ſpoken of his own kingdom: he ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſeemeth to wave

They were glorious before, in the kingdom of the ſon, the Lord Chriſt: but then, in the kingdom of their father, they ſhall be more glorious, then, and there: for as ſayeth our Lord Chriſt: they ſhall then ſhine forth as the ſun, very gloriouſly. In the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt, they ſhall be very glorious; ſharing with the Lord Chriſt, and being like him: far beyond the glory of the Saints in their higheſt attainer here, or elſwhere, before that time: they ſhall ſhine forth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with the Lord Chriſt in glory then: holy <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 12. 3. tells us, that then, <hi>they that be wiſe</hi> [or have been wiſe in their day] <hi>ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament</hi> [very ferene] <hi>and they that turn</hi> [or have turned] <hi>many to righteouſneſs;</hi> [ſhall ſhine] <hi>as the ſtarrs, for ever, and ever:</hi> very bright and ſhining: there will be great glory in the kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But in the kingdom of their father, they ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun: the glory of the ſun, is far greater then that of the ſtarrs, or Firmament; ſo faith the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41. there is one glory of the ſun, another of the Moon, and another glory of the ſtarrs, for one ſtarr, differeth from another, in glory: degrees there are, and will be, the glory of the ſun, is the greateſt. In the kingdom of the Son will be great glory; the righteous will ſhine, there, as the ſtars: but in the kingdom of the father; they ſhine forth as the ſun; more gloriouſly By way of illuſtration: the eye is able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light of the Firmament; and the brightneſs of the ſtars, in their light and brightneſs: but what eye is able to behold the ſun, in the full glory and brightneſs of it? As the glory of the ſun, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts the glory of the ſtars, and Firmament: ſo will the glory of the kingdom of the father and the attainer of the righteous, then, and there, exceed that of the righteous their attainer, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord Chriſt. In the kingdom of the father, they ſhall ſhine forth, as the ſun.</p>
                     <p>It may be looked upon as a very great thing, for raiſed Saints, newly raiſed out of their graves, and reunited, body, and ſoul, in one again; and the changed Saints, then, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye; as it is written in that great miſtery, ſhewed by the Apoſtle

The wiſdom of God the father, did foreſee, and order, for that cauſe (it may be) a gradual way of proceed, from glory, to glory; from a leſſer, to a greater; and the greateſt, and higheſt, of all, laſt; like the great and good maſter, that kept the greateſt, and beſt, till laſt; that ſo the Saints, might with the more facility, take on the glory of the kingdom of the father; having been a long while before in the kingdom of the ſon, the Lord Chriſt, there, enjoying that great glory; they, with the more facility, may take on that greater, and higher glory, of ſhining as the ſun, in the kingdom of the father.</p>

                     <p>Great is the miſtery of God, manifeſted in the fleſh: the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of minding the matter ſo; is ſo neceſſary; as to deny it; or decry it as an errour; hath very ill conſequences attending of it: of which; more hereafter. Here, I ſay only this; let the context be minded, and the cloſe, be weighed: that of the Lord Chriſt, the ſon; delivering up his kingdom, that God the father, may be all, in all: the righteous ſhining as the ſtars, in the kingdom of the ſon: and ſhining as the ſun, in the kingdom of the father, ſucceeding the delivering up of the kingdom of the ſon, to the father, that ſo, the father may be all, in all: I ſay, let it be minded; and ſee, if it doth not hold forth the diſtinction: as betwixt, the father, and the ſon: ſo, betwix that, of the kingdom of the ſon, and that, of the father ſucceeding, that God, the father, may be all; in all.</p>
                     <p>And it may be taken notice of, that the Lord Chriſt, ſpeaketh very often, <hi>of the father;</hi> and of his father, and ours: but no where doth he call himſelf, father: but ſtiles himſelf, the ſon of man, very often; and ſometimes, the ſon of God alſo. Many, in a general way, ſeem without any diſtinction at all, or putting any difference, between the kingdom of God, the creator of heaven, and earth: the kingdom of Chriſt, and the kingdom of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and accordingly they ſpeak, and apply: but how rightly they do, in ſo underſtanding and applying the Scriptures ſo; may be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Further, in the 26th. of <hi>Mathew;</hi> we have ſomething that ſeems to look that way: our Lord Chriſt, having eat, and drank with his diſciples, ſays to them in <hi>vers.</hi> 29. <hi>I will not drink henceforth, of this fruit of the vine, untill that day when I drink it new with you in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kingdom.</hi> The father will have a kingdom; as the ſon will have a kingdom: theſe ſeem to be diſtinctly ſpoken of in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The ſon will have a kingdom, in the which he will reign, and which he will deliver up to the father, and the father become all, in all: the end of the one, (to wit, that of the ſons) being the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fathers, <hi>when he ſhall be all, in all.</hi> As there is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt ſpoken of, very plainly expreſſed, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, there, ſhining as the ſtars: ſo there is the kingdom of God the father ſpoken of, and the righteous, there, ſhining as the ſun; as is before ſet forth: and theſe ſeem to be very diſtinctly ſet forth in the ſcriptures. As the ſon, is not the father, nor the father, is the ſon: even ſo, it ſeemeth to be, in regard of the kingdom of the ſon,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106759:18"/> given him of the father; and the kingdom of the father, <hi>When he ſhall be all, in all.</hi> The ſon will have a kingdom, which the father hath appointed him. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 29. And he is gone to receive it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 12. He will come again, and his kingdom will come with him, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. In his kingdom, he will reign to the end; and then deliver it up to the Father, and the Father be all in all; In his kingdom, when, and where, our Lord Chriſt will drink with, his, of the fruit of the vine: in his fathers kingdom. Our Lord Chriſt <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 30. ſpeaketh of eating, and drinking, in his own kingdom, in expreſſe words, and very diſtinctly, <hi>that ye may eat, and drink at my table in my kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. But in the 26th. of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I will not henceforth drink of this fruit of the vine, till I drink it now with you in my fathers kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We reade of the father, and the ſon, and take them diſtinctly, and do not take them, as on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>This we know, that no whoremonger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath any inheritance, in the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God,</hi> to wit, God the father; and not, that the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God, there, is all one kingdom, as ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. We cannot without offering loſſe to the ſcripture and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a kind of tautologie, but count them as diſtinct kingdoms. We read, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. The Apoſtles prayer unto God in the behalf of the Coloſſians was, that the eyes of their underſtanding might be opened, to the acknowledgment [of what?] of the myſtery of God, and the father, and of Chriſt. Very diſtinct: the three, in one, is a great myſtery: the three diſtinct; are three great myſteries. The myſtery of God, (to wit, the creator of heaven, and earth) a great myſterie: the myſterie of God the father, reconciling the world unto himſelf, (to believers; by Jeſus Chriſt, our bleſſed redeemer, and Saviour. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9.) a great myſterie! the myſtery alſo of God manifeſted in the fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. is a great myſterie.</p>
                     <p>As we reade of the myſterie of God; the father and of Chriſt: ſo we reade of the kingdom of God, and of the father, and of Chriſt, very diſtinctly held forth in the holy ſcriptures: and to be able to underſtand them aright, ſeemeth a great attayner. To take them, and make them all one, and the ſame; ſeemeth to be an offering of loſs to the holy ſcriptures, as if they had ſpoken in vain. To ſay, that the myſterie of God, and the myſterie of the father, and the myſterie of Chriſt, are one, and the ſame thing, without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all; and ſo, in like manner, to ſay, the kingdom of God,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106759:19"/> and the kingdom of the father, and the kingdom of Chriſt given him of the father; to hold, or ſay, that theſe are all one, and the ſame; ſeemeth to reflect on the ſpirit, by which the holy ſcriptures were written; <hi>All ſcripture being given by inſpiration of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Holy men of God, of old, ſpake, as they were moved by the holy ſpirit,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. Chriſt, our Lord will drink of the fruit of the vine, in his fathers kingdom. As to that of difference and diſtinctnes betweeen the kingdoms forenamed; that in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 5. ſeemeth to hold forth. ſomething: the Apoſtle, there, ſpeaking of ſeveral ſorts of ſinners, ſayeth, <hi>know ye not, that the unrighteous, ſhall not inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. In like manner that before, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 5. He ſaith, <hi>we know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, that is an Idolater; hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God;</hi> to wit, God the father's kingdom; ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners, they have no part or Inheritance, in the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt: they ſhall in no wiſe enter there, or dwell there <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. There will be no way found, or entrance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, into the Everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. In like manner, they ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the kingdom of God the father, more high and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; when God ſhall be all, in all: no wicked ſinners ſhall aſcend thither, or dwell there; this <hi>know,</hi> [as it is ſaid] <hi>the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> [the father:] it will be too high, and too glorious. In the kingdom of God, the creator, they have lived, and do live, as ſomtime rich <hi>Dives</hi> did; and had his ſhare and part of good things. The caſe will be otherwiſe then; when the kingdom of the father takes place, where God ſhall be all, in all; that of the pſalmiſt being very prophetical, and ſpoken prayer-wiſe, may be minded, as that which will be made good. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 35. <hi>Let the ſinners be conſumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more,</hi> &amp;c. The ſinners will be conſumed out of the earth, in the time of the kingdom of Chriſt, in the new earth, and before his kingdom be ended. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 17. 18. 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 9. ſee the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and others of the like import: but when the kingdom of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes place, and God the father be all, in all: then the wicked will be no more. Halelujah. Our Lord Chriſt will drink of the fruit of the Vine there, and the righteous will ſhine as the ſun, there; where thoſe wicked ſinners ſhall not come, nor be no more: then: for ever.</p>

                     <p>The kingdom of God as the creator of Heaven and earth, of which the holy Scriptures ſpeak very much, It is a ſubject, ſo high and comprehenſive, and ſo much ſpoken of it in the holy Scriptures; as that I ſhall only ſpeak a few things in a General way, and that by way of eſſay. This kingdom began with the creation, wherein ſoveranity was delegated to <hi>Adam,</hi> and it laſted till the floud, when all fleſh periſhed. Then from the floud, it hath been carried, and will be carried on, to the great burning to come, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 6. 7. of the world that now is: when the world to come, ſhall take place, and the bleſſed kingdom, and Power, and dominion of our Lord Chriſt ſhall take place, and begin: he, then, a king, will take to himſelf his great power and reign; and all rule, authority, and power reſt in him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 17. all power, and rule, being given unto him, both in heaven, and in earth, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 18. of the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the maker of heaven; and earth.</p>

                     <p>Of the kingdom, rule, and government of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the maker of heaven, and earth; we may mind it as from the floud; how he ruled, and gave power to rule under him, in his kingdom; from <hi>Noah,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs:</hi> to <hi>Moſes Joſhua,</hi> and the judges, unto the time of <hi>Samuel, Acts.</hi> 13. 20. then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a king, and God gave them a king; <hi>Saul,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106759:20"/> a goodly perſon, and ſome way eminent: but in that their deſire, which was condeſcended to of God; God ſaid to <hi>Samuel, they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>Saul's</hi> reign laſted not: but for his diſobedience to the king of heaven, he was put down: and God, the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and ruler over all; choſe <hi>David,</hi> and his ſeed, a type of our Lord Chriſt. Touching <hi>David,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord hath found a man after his own heart,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 14. and his race, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods promiſe, continued. <hi>Solomon</hi> that eminent one for wiſdom continued after him, and he advanced the kingdom to the greateſt height of glory that ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> attained unto. A breach was made in that kingdom, and ſtate, not only in the diviſion: but in the departing of the Scepter, as it hath been for a long time.</p>
                     <p>The kingdoms of this world, out of the line of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> in a more general way, they have been ordered according to his pleaſure. The rulers, and ſovereigns, have been ſet up, and taken down, according to the pleaſure of the great <hi>Jehovah:</hi> from the beginning it hath been ſo. And to particularize a few. Thoſe great monarchs, and monarchies; the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Graecians</hi> and the <hi>Romans;</hi> and all others under them; and not under them; as the ethnich potentates; they have been at the ordering of God Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; though, it may be, ſome of them have ſaid, and may ſay, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid of old; <hi>who is the Lord?</hi> And as it hath been: ſo it will be; his kingdom will rule over all; and he ſhall give the power, and dominion to whom he pleaſeth: <hi>for he is God over all, bleſſed for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Untill the time come, that the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt take place, and his dominion and rule begin, when he ſhall take to him his great power and reign, and after, deliver it to God the father: ſo as God the creator of heaven and earth, will be firſt, in kingdom, and rule. The great <hi>Alpha:</hi> and will be the laſt, in kingdom, rule, and power: the great <hi>Omega.</hi> The middle; it will be to the Lord Chriſt, when he takes it on: all power in heaven and earth being given unto him; and he muſt reign, till the end, and then deliver up; and God the father, be all, in all; the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega.</hi> In the kingdom of God Almighty, there hath been two great <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums,</hi> or two, that have been eminent, between God, and man, beſides others; namely, <hi>Moſes,</hi> a great Prophet, raiſed up of God,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106759:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> of great authority, and rule: and the Lord Chriſt, ſent of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; firſt to ſuffer, and then to be highly advanced, and to reign: but I ſhall forbear to dilate further.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, we propoſe that direction of our Lord Chriſt, about prayer, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. from <hi>vers.</hi> 6. to <hi>vers.</hi> 15. which ſeemeth to ſpeak to the ſame matter; to wit, the kingdom of the father: and his being all, in all: <hi>after this manner</hi> [ſaith our Lord] <hi>pray ye: our father which art in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thy kingdom come;</hi> the kingdom of the father, we are to pray that it may come: implying, it was not then, come: and likewiſe, that it was not that kingdom which had been ſince the creation; then was; and now is; and alſo ſhall be; till the kingdom of our Lord Chriſt, takes place: but, a kingdom that was to come, when our Lord Chriſt ſhall reſign, and God the father, be all, in all, and his kingdom ſhall come and take place, and wonderfull ſhall be the glory of it; beyond all conceiving. This kingdom we are to pray, that it may come. I do not here intend the excluding of the kingdom of grace, or glory, to be comprehended within this deſire or prayer; the further advance of the kingdom of grace, in the increaſe of the number, and the advance of the intreſt of God and Chriſt, here; may be included in it; and likewiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the kingdom of our Lord Chriſt, when he, and his kingdom ſhall appear, and come in power, and great glory. Whatever of God, and Chriſt, hath not yet had its time, and higheſt attainer: we may pray that it may come, as included in this direction of our Lord: <hi>thy kingdom come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in ſpecial; as that which was moſtly intended by our Lord Chriſt in this direction; was, that the kingdom of God the father, that it may come; being the laſt, and higheſt in glory; when God the father will be all, in all; in kingdom, ſovereignty, and rule; the great <hi>Omega.</hi> This being that, it is likely, which the voge and ſpirits of the ſervants of God in their deſires and wiſhes, go out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that, which their dayly expreſſions are of; as the ſum of all bleſſedneſs, to wit, heaven, and glory; and to be with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father in glory, in his kingdom, as the uttermoſt of all their deſires. The cloſe of our Lords prayer hath much in this his atteſt: <hi>for thine is the kingdom, the Power, and the glory, for ever, and ever Amen:</hi> all, in all. He had in the times, and ages of the world, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated and given kingdoms, and authorities, and powers to others: he hath given unto the Lord Chriſt, kingdom, power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106759:21"/> he hath made and appointed him, to be king, of kings, and Lord, of Lords, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15 and he ſhall come, and take to him his great power, and all nations ſerve, and obey him: but when the end of his kingdom is come; he will deliver up all unto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and be ſubject unto him himſelf: and the father ſhall take all into his own power, and be all, in all: <hi>for thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever, and ever,</hi> Amen: It will be ſo in an eminent manner, then: God the father, his will be the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, and all, in all. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> hath a like cloſe: he having ſpoken of the rejection of the Jewes, and taking on the Gentils; and the reſtoring of the Jewes again, by the coming of the deliverer out of <hi>Sion,</hi> when all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved: high myſteries which he admired! and cryed out; <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his Judgements, and his ways paſt finding out! Rom.</hi> 11. 33. he cloſes thus, in <hi>vers.</hi> 36. <hi>for of him, and through him,</hi> [or by him] <hi>and to him, are all things,</hi> [to his glory] <hi>to him be glory for ever.

                     <p>I further propoſe, as worthy our conſideration; that conſolatory ſpeech of our Lord Chriſt to his diſciples, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1. 2. 3. they being much troubled at the thoughts of his departure from them; he ſaith to them; <hi>let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God,</hi> [to wit, the father] ſo is the Creed, <hi>I believe in God the father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> &amp;c. <hi>believe alſo in me.</hi> [God the ſon]: that he ſpake of God the father, the words following ſhow: <hi>in my fathers houſe:</hi> he doth not ſay, in his own houſe or kingdom: but in his fathers houſe. Whether by, houſe, here, be meant the new heaven, and new earth, wherein will be ſeveral degrees of glory? <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 15. to 19. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41 or whether heaven only? or whether both together? to wit, the kingdom of the ſon, and the kingdom of the father? ſo it may ſeem to be; it being a bleſſed eſtate they are to be in, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, at his coming, hath received them to himſelf: or whether it be a borrowed way of ſpeaking? I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but leave it to conſideration. The tendencie is conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Diſciples: <hi>in my fathers houſe are many manſion pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> places of great contentment, happy repoſe, and much bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs: I ſhall not venture to allegoriſe this ſaying of our Lord; but rather believe it as it is ſpoken, for that our Lord doth atteſt it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106759:21"/> ſaying, <hi>If it were not ſo, I would have told you.</hi> There is ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuch bleſſednes, in my fathers houſe: and <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> A place: our Lord tells his diſciples, he goeth to prepare for them: not expreſſing where it ſhall be: happily, in his fathers houſe: very great and ſpacious like the maſter of it; the great <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah. I go to prepare a place for you:</hi> hapily, in his own houſe, or kingdom, which he is one to receive, <hi>Luk</hi> 19. 12. 15. in the new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the new earth; where he will dwell, and reſide with his, <hi>for a thouſand years, Rev.</hi> 20. 6. Further, he ſaith, <hi>if I go</hi> [or though I go] <hi>and prepare a place for you; I will come again,</hi> good newes and comfortable; the Lord Chriſt: gone into heaven; will come again:] <hi>and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> Very comfortable, and gladding to all his, that love him, and are ſad for the abſence of him: but ſhall abundantly rejoyce when they ſhall ſee him again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 22. <hi>They ſhall be with him in his kingdom;</hi> they ſhall never be ſevered from him, or deprived of his preſence any more, but <hi>be for ever with him,</hi> 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17. with the which, the ſervants of the Lord Jeſus may comfort themſelves, and one another, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bids them to do; with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of thoſe ſayings.</p>
                     <p>But where will our Lord Chriſt be then, to wit, when he is come from heaven? may ſome ask? anſwer; he will be in his kingdom: for he is the <hi>noble man, that is gone into a far countrey, to receive for himſelf a kingdom, and to return, Luk.</hi> 19. 12. And being returned and come again; <hi>he will ſend and gather all his elect, to himſelf, and they ſhall then be with him where he is,</hi> he prayed ſo to his father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will, that thoſe that thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, be with me where I am that they may behold my glory:</hi> which is the ſame with thoſe words, aforemontioned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> If it yet be asked, where our Lord Chriſt will be then? to wit at his coming? we ſay, as before, in his kingdom, in the new earth: where thoſe that are his, <hi>ſhall live and reign with him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, Rev.</hi> 20. 6. The Lord Chriſt hath made thoſe that are his; <hi>kings and Preiſts unto God the father, and they ſhall reign on the earth. Rev.</hi> 5. 10. he, the Lord Chriſt, when he hath received his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, muſt reign; till the end: and then deliver up to the father. While he ſtays; they ſtay with him; when he goes, they go with him; a higher, and greater attayner of glory, they ſhall proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106759:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> then; they ſhall have manſion places prepared; they ſhall ſhine as the ſun, on the fathers kingdom; they ſhall be ſtill with Chriſt: <hi>they ſhall drink of the fruit of the vine with him in the fathers kingdom,</hi> be it in heaven, or wherever it ſhall be.</p>
                     <p>The father, and great Lord of the houſe; that good houſeholder will keep the higheſt; and beſt enjoyments, till the laſt: and ſo great it will be; <hi>as the eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man, the things which God</hi> [to wit, the father] <hi>hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> which they, then, ſhall enjoy in his kingdom, when, they ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun, for ever. It is true, in reſpect of the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt, alſo, and the ſaints enjoyments there: it is not manifeſt what we ſhall be for happines and bleſſednes; then, and there, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. But higher, and greater, ſhall the ſaints enjoy, and be made partakers of, in the kingdom of the father, when God is all in all. This diſtinction of kingdoms; and gradual way of proceed, from glory, to glory, or to higher, and higher glory; may hapily, ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that think of nothing, but ſtepping into heaven, preſently, when they leave this world; but I ſhall forbear.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Something held forth concerning a mixed or interwoven way of ſpeaking in the holy ſcriptures, when the kingdom of God, and of the Lord Chriſt, are ſpoken of.</hi>

                     <p>FOr the better minding and taking knowledge of this matter: I propoſe; how that in ſundry prophecies, and high ſayings, in the old, and new Teſtament, concerning kingdom, and glory, to come; there ſeemeth to be an interwoven or mixed way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſome part of the matter, relating to the Lord Chriſt, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and glory; and ſome part, relating to the kingdom of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the high ſoveraignty and glory, when he ſhall be all, in all: the matter warily minded; it may hapily appear to be ſo: in way of inſtance; we ſhall propoſe a place or two.</p>
                     <p>That in the 1 Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, Chap.</hi> 6. 15. 16. ſeemeth to be ſo, <hi>Paul</hi> having layd a charge on <hi>Timothy, vers.</hi> 13. as likewiſe he had done before, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 21. And this charge, it being as is ſet forth:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106759:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> before God, or in the ſight of God, who quickneth all things: and before Jeſus Chriſt, who before <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> witneſſed a good confeſſion; <hi>that thou keep this commandement,</hi> &amp;c. How long, it might be asked? he anſwers, <hi>until the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt: vers.</hi> 15. Which in his times he ſhall ſhew, [to wit, them himſelf in his glory: for that is a ſure word, and ſhall be made good: the Lord Chriſt, ſhall be manifeſted and ſhewn forth in his times, to be the only potentate, the king of kings, and the Lord of Lords: the words are], <hi>Who is the bleſſed, and only potentate; the king of kings, and Lord of Lords, That hath all power in heaven and in earth given unto him of the father, Math.</hi> 28. 18. He being highly advanced, far above all principallitie, and power, and might, and dominion; <hi>and every name that is named</hi> [to wit of power, and dignity] <hi>not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come, Ephes.</hi> 1. 21. In the world to come, will his kingdom, and reign be: for that will not <hi>be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Angels, Heb.</hi> 2. 5. but to the Lord Chriſt, and thoſe he ſhall authorize to <hi>rule with him, over ten cities, and over five cities, Luk.</hi> 19. 15. 17. 19. When that bleſſed time ſhall take place, when the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt ſhall be come: then the Lord Jeſus, that great potentate, king of kings; ſhall rule and reign in his kingdom, before his antients groriouſly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 23. That, this, thus far, is ſpoken of the Lord; there is, I conceive, little doubt, or queſtion, to be made of it.</p>
                     <p>But that which followeth, in <hi>vers.</hi> 16. ſeemeth to be ſpoken of God the father, who in <hi>vers.</hi> 13. of this, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. is named the <hi>quickner of all things, who only hath immortallitie,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord Chriſt, he had no Immortality: the ſcriptures do not attribute that to him: he dyed, he ſuffered, according to the deſign of heaven: he redeemed and purchaſed the Church with his own bloud; <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>He was humbled to death, even the death of the Croſſe. Phil.</hi> 2. 8. and was afterward <hi>advanced highly by God the father.</hi> It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>dwelling in the light, which no man can approch unto, whom no man hath ſeen or can ſee:</hi> this ſeemeth to be ſpoken of God the father, and is true in him; and is not applicable to the Lord Chriſt; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom it is ſaid, <hi>we ſaw his glory, as the glory of the only begotten ſon of the father; Joh.</hi> 1. 14. Holy <hi>Stephen, he ſaw heaven opened, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God. Acts.</hi> 7. 55. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe ſaw him: and it is ſaid, <hi>When he cometh in the clouds, every eye ſhall ſee him, Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106759:23"/>
                     <p>But God the father, the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> told <hi>Moſes he could not ſee him,</hi> and in great condeſcenſion ſhewed him his back parts. He is the inviſible God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. The holy ſcripture tells us, <hi>that no man hath ſeen God</hi> [to wit the father] <hi>at any time,</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 12. 20. His brightneſs is ſo ſerene where he dwelleth, that no mortal, no created eye, is able to approch unto it, or to abide the beholding of it.</p>
                     <p>But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Image of the inviſible God: as we have ſeen him, as before is ſaid; ſo <hi>we ſhall ſee him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in his glory, and be with him for ever;</hi> as he made it his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto his father, that it might be ſo; <hi>When he ſhall again appear, we ſhall then appear with him in glory:</hi> and as holy <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>When he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is. Joh.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                     <p>The cloſe of that ſcripture ſeemeth to relate to God the father likewiſe; <hi>to whom be honour, and power everlaſting, Amen:</hi> the great Omega. That is, and will be all in all.</p>
                     <p>Further, that of <hi>Daniel.</hi> 7. Is of like conſideration, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>vers.</hi> 22. It ſpeaketh of <hi>the ancient of days:</hi> God the father: very high things are ſpoken of him: that in <hi>vers.</hi> 13. One like the ſon of man; ſeemeth clearly to be meant of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Much the ſame, ſeemeth that to be, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 11. <hi>I ſaw a great white throne, and him that ſate thereon, from whoſe face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them: and I ſaw the dead, ſmall, and great, ſtand before God,</hi> [to wit, God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:] it ſeemeth to be ſpoken of him: but that which follows in that <hi>verſe</hi> relating to the judgment, it is very likely to be meant of the Lord Chriſt, to whom all judgment is committed: <hi>all judgment is given to the ſon, by the father;</hi> and as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5. That he is ready <hi>to judge the quick, and the dead:</hi> all muſt appear before his tribunal, and be judged by him: this of judicature, to the end of that 20. <hi>chapter,</hi> relateth in a tacit way to the Lord Chriſt. That in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſeemeth to be of like conſideration: and other ſcriptures, that I ſhall forbear to name: being of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven way and manner of ſpeaking; of the power and dominion of the father, and likewiſe of the ſon, the Lord Chriſt. I ſhall end theſe eſſays, with that prophetical <hi>Pſalm</hi> of the kingly prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. ſpeaking to his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> as the type: but chiefly relating to a higher and greater <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the antitype, namely, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: very high, and great things are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106759:23"/> ſpoken of in that <hi>Pſalm</hi> concerning the kingdom of our Lord Chriſt, how that <hi>in his days,</hi> as in <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of peace ſhall be, ſo long as the Moon endureth, vers.</hi> 8. <hi>he ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.</hi> Then he ſpeaketh of the ſubmiſſion of kings and of their bringing of gifts, ſaying, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. Yea, <hi>all kings ſhall fall down before him: all nations ſhall ſerve him:</hi> Then he ſpeaketh of his great kindnes to the poor and needy, and of how high eſteem they ſhall be in his ſight, and how he ſhall take care of them, and do for them; <hi>for which he ſhall be dayly praiſed. Vers.</hi> 17. It is ſaid, <hi>His name ſhall be continued for ever, his name ſhall endure as long as the ſun, and men ſhall be bleſſed in him. And all nations ſhall call him bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Great will be the glory of our Lord Chriſt in his kingdom; and when he ſhall come in his glory, and reign in his kingdom; of which there ſeemeth little doubt, but that this <hi>Pſalm</hi> treateth of it: and bleſſed will they be, that ſhall enjoy their ſhare therein.</p>
                     <p>But towards the end of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the prophet ſeemeth to turn and addreſſe himſelf to the Author and giver of all this glory and bleſſedneſs, namely, God the father, with the which he cloſeth the <hi>Pſalm:</hi> and in the two laſt verſes, ſayeth thus; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael who only doth wondrous things; and bleſſed be his glorious name for ever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.</hi> With the which he cloſes, as I ſhall alſo theſe eſſayes; referring the whole to the ſerious conſideration of the wiſe in heart.</p>

                  <p>THou haſt here offered to thy view and conſideration, that, which few haply have much minded; though it be a very great thing: a miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no leſs: and that, which it is likely will be found as a key that will help to open divers great prophecies and high ſayings in the holy Scriptures, which ſome have been very ready to allegorize and put ſome notion of a ſpiritual meaning on them; as if that were all: whereby they have drawn a veil over them; rendring them another thing. This miſtery, it relateth to the very time of the ſecond coming of the Lord Chriſt; when thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, believing in Jeſus, ſhall be changed, in a moment, without dying: they ſhall put off corruption and mortallity; and put on incorruption, immortality, and everlaſting life, and be rechanged into their former ſtate as man was before his fall: and, it is very likely, they will be the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world to come: and ſuch as ſhall inherit and dwell in the new earth. Conſider of it, and what is offered about it; it may be very true, though thou doſt not underſtand it: or at firſt reſent it. Remember how it was with the diſciples of our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 31. 34. our Lord told them, <hi>vers.</hi> 31. of what he was to ſuffer, and that all things that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the prophets concerning the ſon of man, ſhould be fulfilled: and that at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he ſhould be ſpitefully dealt withall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and delivered to the gentiles: as they did. <hi>vers.</hi> 34. it is ſaid, they underſtood none of thoſe things; &amp; theſe ſayings were hid from them: neither knew they the things that were ſpoken: in like manner, our Lord Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, have ſpoken and declared many things, concerning his coming again in power and great glory; and that every eye ſhall ſee him. They have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of very many great things that wlll contemporize and take place then and amongſt them; in particular, this miſtery ſhewed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> of the not aying of the ſervants of God, but being changed, whilſt alive, and put into their former happy eſtate which was loſt in <hi>Adam:</hi> but many of the ſervants of God, and followers of the Lord Chriſt underſtand none of thoſe things, and the ſaying is hid from them, and they know it not. Haply, it may be even ſo, in this our day; and in particular concerning this miſtery, this being changed whileſt alive; in a moment. It is likely, it may be better reſented and underſtood hereafter, and therefore I ſhall leave it to the giver of light and underſtanding, to give forth as he ſhall pleaſe. The day haſteneth: the time it draweth nigh; he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. In the mean time, the juſt ſhall live by faith, Farewell.</p>

And ſo according to that alluſive way of ſpeaking of ſowing: mans body is ſo ſown in corruption, and raiſed in incorruption: God giveth a body as he pleaſeth, ſo as he giveth to the grain. A body incorruptible, as is ſet forth in <hi>vers.</hi> 43. <hi>it is ſown in diſhonor, it is raiſed in glory; It is ſown in weakneſs, it is</hi>

                        <hi>raiſed in power: it is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi> There will be a difference betwixt what they are when ſown, and what they will be when raiſed; in ſundry conſiderations. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of <hi>vers.</hi> 44. the Apoſtle doth poſitively aſſert, <hi>that there is a natural body</hi> [ſuch is the preſent condition of all the ſons of <hi>Adam] and there is a ſpiritual body;</hi> ſo will be the caſe and condition of all the juſt, hereafter, when they are raiſed again. He ſpeaketh, as the holy Scriptures uſe to do, of things, that as yet are not, as if, at preſent, they were. There is a ſpiritual body: it will ſurely be ſo. What he means by ſpiritual body, the matter following, in <hi>vers.</hi> 45. doth ſhew; he confirms the differencing <hi>ſo,</hi> by what is written, ſaying, <hi>and ſo it is written: the firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living ſoul, a</hi> living man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>God breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, &amp; man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a living ſoul.</hi> The laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to wit, the Lord Chriſt, the prince of life, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3 15. <hi>He was made a quickning ſpirit:</hi> being the firſt-fruits of thoſe that roſe from death. <hi>vers.</hi> 46. He ſhews that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate is firſt, the ſpiritual ſtate is afterward. <hi>vers.</hi> 47. the firſt man is of the earth, earthly: <hi>Adam</hi> was formed of the duſt of the earth: the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> or man (the Lord Chriſt) from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>VErs. 51. <hi>Behold, I ſhew you a myſtery: we ſhall not all dye: but we ſhall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump,</hi> &amp;c. the matter is high and conſiderable; a myſtery, or great ſecret, little known, or underſtood. He begins the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, with a, <hi>behold:</hi> which ſets a mark on it, as ſome noteable great thing: great ſecret, little known: which; <hi>behold:</hi> calls for the minding and conſideration of, <hi>I ſhew you: I</hi> Paul; <hi>the Apoſtle of the gentiles.</hi> And he was a man, of much knowledge and underſtanding, in the great myſteries of the Goſpel; and alſo of an infallible ſpirit. He hath declared, and ſhewed it; and none beſides himſelf hath done it: and he hath done it, again, and again, and poſitively aſſerted it to us, <hi>I ſhew you:</hi> you gentiles; to whom he wrote his epiſtle. You the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> and all other the ſervants of the Lord Jeſus: the thing ſhewed, <hi>is a miſtery:</hi> that ye may know, underſtand, and believe it.</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:106759:27"/>
                     <p>The Apoſtle proceeds to declare it: firſt, negatively: <hi>we ſhall not all dye:</hi> then poſitively he atteſts: <hi>that we ſhall all be changed.</hi> There is much conſiderable in both: the perſons in both, in the which he includes himſelf. <hi>We ſhall not:</hi> and <hi>we ſhall:</hi> enquirie may be made, who he means, by <hi>we?</hi> it is very likely, he means the ſervants of God, believers in Jeſus Chriſt, then alive in the body at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Chriſt: thoſe are the <hi>[we]</hi> that ſhall not dye: thoſe are the <hi>[we]</hi> that ſhall all be changed. The prayer of the Lord Chriſt, will be anſwered then, and in them: <hi>father I will, that thoſe which thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. Not one related; ſo; ſhall fail of that great bleſſednes.</p>
                     <p>Death will have a great check, a great blow, then: and loſe of his power, over the righteous ones, at that very time; that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Apoſtle after expreſſes. Over the unrighteous, and unſaved people, and nations; death may have power: not only in reſpect of killing their bodyes; which will be, till a little before the final judicature, or the ſecond, and laſt ſeſſion of judgement begins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 9. but alſo in keeping under, or in the grave, the whole wicked, (all being then dead) until the time that ſeſſion is begun; who are then raiſed, to come thereunto to be judged, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 11. 12. 13. and at the end, and as the concluſion thereof; <hi>death, and hell,</hi> or <hi>the grave; ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> never to have power or a being more, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 14. but as is ſaid before, death hath no power over the righteous after that Chriſt our Lord is come, it being ſaid, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 4. <hi>There ſhall be no more death, neither ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for the former things</hi> [to wit, The old heaven, and earth, with the dying and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therein] <hi>are paſſed away:</hi> which I conceive is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, not only in reſpect of the ſaints that are raiſed at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Chriſt; that they ſhall not dye any more: as alſo the ſaints who were then changed; that they ſhall not dye at all. <hi>[But alſo in reſpect of the converted in that time, who if any alteration afterward paſs upon their bodyes; it will, in all likelyhood, be a change, and ſhall not dye:]</hi> it being ſaid, as before, in reſpect of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>we ſhall not all dye: but we ſhall all be</hi> changed: the not dying: but changing, of the ſaints that remain alive to the coming of the Lord Chriſt, being an eminent token <hi>and forerunner</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>Further, we may take knowledg, that in the holy ſcripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106759:27"/> that to ſleep in the grave and to dye, are one, and the ſame: and ſo; to ſay, we ſhall not all ſleep, and we ſhall not all dye, are terms equivolent, and do import one, and the ſame thing: ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 36. David <hi>fell aſleep, and was layd to his fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 14. So <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Many that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake,</hi> &amp;c. as to that of death or dying: ſee the many expreſſions: as here: <hi>in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye: death went over all: it is appointed to men once to dye,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. Jacob <hi>went down into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and dyed, he, and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Acts.</hi> 7. 15. ſo, as his negation of the Apoſtle, leadeth to take knowledge of a very high caſe, wherein there is much of miſtery: <hi>we ſhall not all dye;</hi> the reſtriction that is in this <hi>all,</hi> is only to the righteous, then living and remaining at the coming of the Lord Chriſt: this <hi>all</hi> relateth only to them: they are the <hi>all that ſhall not dye but be all changed,</hi> then: but none of the unrighteous ſhall be ſo.</p>
                     <p>At which time: death that had reigned ſo long over <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his poſteritie: his power over the juſt, over the righteous, ſhall then be ſuperſeded: they ſhall be put into a condition out of his reach; having put off mortalitie and put on immortality and life everlaſting. As every thing that hath a beginning; will have and end: ſo will death: and in order to the ceaſing of his power over the righteous, and putting a ſtop to his univerſal reign; it will begin, then. <hi>So,</hi> as that appointment of death to all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. is to be underſtood: <hi>So:</hi> to wit, untill this time take place, this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery be actually opened, <hi>we ſhall not all dye;</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>when this corruptible, hath put on incorruption, and this mortal, hath put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> and made this happy change; <hi>then it ſhall be;</hi> and alſo that Prophecy fulfilled, <hi>death is ſwallowed up in victory. vers.</hi> 24. <hi>latter part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the way, we may take notice: who would have thought in a likely way that that Prophecy, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 25. 8. ſhould reach ſo far as to that time? and to have its fulfilling then; ſo long after? who is there, that would have underſtood it ſo? had not the Apoſtle ſo declared it: that, then, <hi>death ſhould be ſwallowed up in victory?</hi> we ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſpeak further to the firſt part of the miſtery, namely, <hi>that we ſhall not all dye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond part, is: <hi>but we ſhall all be changed.</hi> All the juſt or righteous; then: alive at the coming of the Lord Chriſt, ſhall be <hi>ſo</hi> changed. It medleth not with the unjuſt: <hi>we ſhall be changed:</hi> the conſideration of the <hi>change</hi> it ſelf, and wherein it conſiſts, we ſhall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106759:28"/> refer to the Apoſtle his following deſcription of it, and ſhall make ſome enquiry what other Scriptures ſpeak of it, and witneſs to it: firſt, that in <hi>Paul.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>who ſhall change</hi> [to wit, the Lord Chriſt, ſhall at his coming from heaven, make that change] <hi>our vile body</hi> [or corrupt and ſinfull body] <hi>that it may faſhioned like unto his</hi> [to wit, pure, ſpotleſs, and incorrupt] <hi>glorious body. Col.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>when Chriſt ſhall appear then ſhall we appear with him in glory: be like him, and ſee him as he is:</hi> as holy <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>this change</hi> is wrought by a mighty hand of power, and working, whereby <hi>he,</hi> namely, the Lord Jeſus, <hi>is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf:</hi> put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſubject them: even ſin, and death, and the grave, and all principality, and power; he is over them all; and he is able to do whatever he pleaſeth: make this change ſo as is after declared. In the next place minde we, that in 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 15. 17. <hi>This we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, and remain</hi> [So] <hi>unto the coming of the Lord:</hi> [implying, there will be ſuch living then:] <hi>ſhall not prevent</hi> [anticipate or get before] <hi>them that are aſleep,</hi> to wit, in their graves: for as in <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>they ſhall be awakened with a ſhout; with the voice of the Arch-Angel and with the trump of God, and ſhall ariſe firſt.</hi> Theſe dead in Chriſt, they will riſe firſt; that being their order. Then comes theſe changed ones; as it is ſaid, <hi>then ſhall we which are alive, and remain, be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the aire.</hi> It is premiſed, that they be firſt changed, in a moment before this conjunction and going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to meet the Lord, ſo: mounting up, like the Eagles with wings. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 41. theſe waiters on the Lord Chriſt, ſhall be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed then: as to do, as is there ſaid: this Propheſy ſeemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to that very time, and to have its fulfilling then. We ſhall: then: both the raiſed, and changed, together, meet the Lord, ſo: and be for ever with him. Bleſſed and happy ſouls indeed.</p>
                     <p>Further the reſtoration of all things; ſpoken by all the holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 21. it doth ſpeak out fully, and in a more general way, this change, and the time of it alſo: man being the principal thing in that bleſſed reſtoration. The heavens, the earth, and the Creatures; they grone for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. 21. 22. they ſhall all ſhare in this change, and ſhall be anſwered unto in their groning. <hi>They ſhall all be changed, as a veſture folded up; and they, being old, ſhall be changed, Pſal.</hi> 102. 26. and <hi>the new heaven, and the new earth,</hi> taking place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. all things ſhall be changed and made new; as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106759:28"/> the Angel ſaid unto <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>behold, I make all things new</hi> even as holy <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>behold, I ſhew you a miſtery; we ſhall not a dye: but be changed.</hi> The holy Apoſtle, <hi>vers.</hi> 52. doth very poſitiue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, the ſecond time, aſſert it: <hi>we ſhall all be changed:</hi> as it is fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by him: ſo, it is nceſſary to be fully believed by us.</p>
                     <p>That which yet further we may minde about this change; whither as a part of the miſtery, or as an appendix, or a relate to it, I ſhall not eſſay to determine. That, we may take notice of, is; how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and tranſcient it will be: <hi>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye:</hi> very-ſudden, and expeditious, will this change be. The coming of the ſon of man: and this as an attendant thereof; will be like the lightning, that is very quick, and tranſcient, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 27. ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in the ſhining from the Eaſt, to the Weſt; over, in a moment of time: as ſudden, as a thought: and while they begin to think: it will be over: in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, it will be over, and done. A very great work; in a very little time; done, and brought to paſs, by a mighty and wonderful workman, the Lord Chriſt, that is able to do all things: it is beyond our reaſon and thoughts, but not our faith. What our Lord Chriſt ſayd to <hi>Thomas,</hi> may here be ſaid in this matter: <hi>bleſſed are they,</hi> that though their reaſon cannot reach it, nor their thoughts comprehend it; yet their faith believes it, becauſe it is written: ſo: in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, in the leaſt of time, very tranſient, will this changing be, <hi>And we ſhall be changed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then laſtly, as relating to the time, when: ſaid, to be <hi>at the laſt trumpet:</hi> for <hi>the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed up incorruptible;</hi> of which, in order. To the dead, raiſed, ſomething hath been ſaid before: and at that very juncture of time, ſhall the living be changed. This ſaying of the Apoſtle: <hi>at the laſt trump;</hi> is conſiderable. Whither it be the laſt, of the ſeven trumpets: (it's very likely,) or ſome other? this riſing, and changing, we are now treating of, ſeems to contemporize <hi>(in time),</hi> with the time of our Lord Chriſt his coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. when that ſcripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. <hi>the kingdoms of this world, are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever,</hi> will have it's through fulfilling, he then having fully taken to himſelf his great power and reign: for which there will be ſo great thanks giving, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>we give thee thanks, O Lord, God almighty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>becauſe thou haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thee thy great power, and haſt reigned.</hi>

                     <p>THe holy Apoſtle, <hi>vers.</hi> 53. 54. further to ſhew the matter, and contents of the miſtery, of <hi>not dying,</hi> but <hi>being changed:</hi> he likewiſe ſheweth the way, and manner of it: ſaying, <hi>this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal, muſt put on immortalitie:</hi> wherein the matter, and likewiſe the manner, is held forth: of which, we ſhall dilate a little. And firſt, for the matter. It is, by being freed, or rid of corruption, defilement, and all pollution: and, by being put into a ſtate of perfect rectitude and uprightneſs: and this, beyond the higheſt degree of mortification, that is to be attained unto here. And on the other part, an attayner of holines, purity, and clearneſs from ſin: an eſtate, beyond the higheſt attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſanctification, that the happy eſtate of regeneration is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall, in the polluted world, in this polluted ſtate. We ſhall in this change, be quite rid of ſin, and defilement, and of ſinning any more: then. That which holy <hi>John</hi> ſayth of thoſe that are the ſons of God, in the bleſſed eſtate of regeneration, ſuch as are born of God: <hi>that they cannot ſin, becauſe they are born of God</hi> (true only in a ſenſe or conſideration) will then in the higheſt ſenſe, and degree, be made good. And it might be ſaid, they cannot ſin, becauſe they are ſo changed, and have put off corruption, and put on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, holyneſs, and purity: the ſeed of ſin and corruption being quite put away, and they in their perſons waſhed from it in the bloud of the lamb. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 14. then: with that change: the miſtery of God will be fully finiſhed, to wit, that of full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the body, the whole man; waited for by thoſe that have the firſt fruits, (or earneſt) of the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. it will then, be enjoyed, <hi>the bodyes of the juſt, and ſaved people, will be changed, and made like the pure, and ſpotleſs</hi> body <hi>of the Lord Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3. 21. what they loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> this change, will reſtore to the juſt, with very many, and great advantages, for it will be a reſtoration, as well as a change; or a reſtoration in the change, very much for the better. And not like that, which attended <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe, which was ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106759:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> much for the worſe. This change, will not only have rectitude, and purity reſtored, but alſo a ſtate of ſtability therein: together with immortality, and that which is the effect, following, namely, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, Life for evermore.</p>
                     <p>This is one of the great things in this change: from a ſtate of ſin, defilement, and corruption, to a ſtate of purity, holyneſs and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: ſo: as (being wholly pure) to be capable to ſee God; as is promiſed <hi>to the pure in heart, Math.</hi> 5 8. and <hi>to ſee the Lord Chriſt, as he is,</hi> in his glory: and alſo <hi>to be for ever with him,</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing in this change, is immortalitie, that put on: and mortality, that put off. This dying body which is dying dayly, as we are carrying it about with us, ſhall then be put into a ſtate and condition of immortality, ſo as not to dye at all, but to live for ever; to have a life eternal, a life everlaſting, inſtead of a life of ſeventy years, or the like, as the poſteritie of <hi>Adam</hi> have had, and hath been counted a bleſſing from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 16.</p>
                     <p>But this change, will put men into a ſtate of freedom from ſin; the cauſe; and death, the effect: as for ſin, and iniquity, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 20. will then be throughly fulfilled: <hi>at that time, ſaith the Lord, the iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reſerve:</hi> theſe changed ones, in a moment; which is ſomething like that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>And I will remove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of that land on one day:</hi> which things have never been made good: theſe prophecyes were never fulfilled as yet: and though they may in a great meaſure have their fulfilling before, yet are they never likely to be ſo fully, and throughly fulfilled, till that day; when ſin and corruption ſhall be taken away, put off, and <hi>death ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> and be no more; and <hi>Mortality ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of life,</hi> to wit, <hi>life everlaſting;</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. ſo as death and Mortality will, then, be no more among the righteous, and ſaved ones; who, then, will be changed, and put into an eſtate, as neither to ſin, nor to dye. And if any ſhould think, they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a ſtate of freedom from ſin, here in this world, before that day; if they could aſſure themſelves, or others, of a like free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from death, and the grave, it were ſomething; otherwiſe, that of holy <hi>John,</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves and the truth is not in us,</hi> compared with <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 9.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106759:30"/> will take place: but then; at that happy time, they ſhall be freed; by being changed, and by putting off corruption, and mortality, and be put into that bleſſed eſtate of freedom, and <hi>glorious liberty of the ſons of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the grace of the new teſtament, or covenant confirmed by the bloud of the Lord Jeſus, the bleſſed mediator, and advocate thereof; ſhall, in the higheſt degree be enjoyed by them; then: and there: ſo: as God, being their God, in a gracious wiſe, and they his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſhall keep them in that bleſſed eſtate, for ever, and they ſhall not depart from him any more for ever. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. but ſhall enjoy everlaſting life, in the enjoyment of happyneſs and felicity, and freedom from all ſorrow and miſery whatever: the bleſſed fruits of that happy change, into immortality, and everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>Now for the manner of this change: it is held forth in a way of putting off, and putting on; a borrowed way of ſpeaking: <hi>this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,</hi> this mortal, muſt put off and put on; to wit, they muſt be freed; quite rid of ſin, corruption, and mortalitie; and made pure, incorrupt and immortal: and this, by putting off, and puting on, as men put off, and put on raiment, change their clothing, put off, filthy, and torn, or old rayment; they put it off, put it away, lay it by, and put on clean ſound and good clothing, new, and freſh; ſo is this putting off and putting on, here. A plain and known thing alluded unto, a uſual, and known thing, for the manner; ſo, <hi>this corruptible muſt put on incorruption;</hi> and <hi>this mortal put on immortality,</hi> having put corruption and mortalitie away, and laid them by.</p>
                     <p>Further, take we notice of that, of the prophet <hi>Zachary, Zech.</hi> 3. It is ſpoken of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> haply as a Type of the thing in hand, or it may be a prophecy eyeing of it, to wit, the change: however the mauner is much the ſame: <hi>Ioſhua was cloathed with filthy garments, and ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angel:</hi> the Angel bids thoſe that ſtood by, <hi>to take away his filthy garments from him</hi> (as the garments of corruption ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the righteous) <hi>and to him, he ſaid, behold, I have cauſed thine iniquitie to paſs from thee</hi> (as ſhall then, the corruption, and ſin, and alſo mortality, paſſe away from the righteous): and it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, with a <hi>behold.</hi> In the one, and in the other. A thing, rare, and conſiderable: <hi>behold, I ſhew you a myſtery: behold, I have cauſed thine iniquity to depart. Joſhua,</hi> his filthy garments, ſhall be taken away. As the changed, ſhall put off their garments of corruption, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: and ſhall put on garments, that are pure, incorrupt, or ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106759:30"/> and immortalitie alſo, and eternal life. There is ſomething de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. very high and marvelous; to wit, <hi>I will cauſe the ini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quitie of that land</hi> [the land of <hi>Canaan, Iſraels</hi> poſſeſſion] <hi>to remove in one day.</hi> Never yet done: and though much of it may be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet is it not likely to be ſo fully and throughly to be done, <hi>till that day of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began, Acts.</hi> 3. 21. and the <hi>time of the glorious manifeſtation of the ſons of God, which the creature grons for, Rom.</hi> 8. 19. when <hi>the Lord Jehovah ſhall bring forth</hi> [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain] <hi>his ſervant, the branch:</hi> this will then be fully performed; and then (according to his promiſe) <hi>we ſhall have a new heaven and a new earth, wherein ſhall dwell righteouſneſs,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>In the which, iniquity will not be found.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. The like we may finde, not only ſomething of the matter before treated of: but of the manner: <hi>we know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands.</hi> &amp;c. If our mortal bodies dye, and periſh; we have better provided, we ſhall have ſuch hereafter. And therefore, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 2. we grone earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſiring to be clothed upon, with our houſe which is from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with more pure, incorruptible, and immortal clothing: <hi>with glory, and honour, and immortality, and life eternal, Rom.</hi> 2. 7. the condition then: will not be righteouſneſs imputed; as now: but righteouſneſs in us; perfect rectitude in our own perſons; we ſhall be like the Lord Chriſt. The attainer then: it will be ſure; beyond that of the attainer in the ſtate of regeneration: and that of imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is likely, will ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The clothing, with our houſe from heaven, as it will be very pure, ſo it will be laſting, and durable; and therefore we groan (or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) to be clothed with it, to be, in that ſtate, that condition. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. if ſo be, that being <hi>[ſo]</hi> clothed with it, we ſhall not be found naked, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were, when they had ſinned, eating the forbidden fruit; they were ſtripped of that clothing of the Image of God, righteouſneſs, and holyneſs, in the which they were made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. it is ſaid, they were naked: ſin, and ſhame entred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Adam</hi> made garments of figtree leaves becauſe of ſhame, and being naked: as, in like manner, his poſterity have done, and yet do; make garments upon that account. In <hi>vers.</hi> 4. the holy Apoſtle ſpeaks further, we groan, being burdened, [with our heavy clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106759:31"/> of ſin, corruption, and mortality] not for that we would be unclothed [namely, dye, and be diſſolved: that, the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth to be the tendency of the creature, or man: ſuch as have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, to groan, for death, or dying; it being as an inſtinct in every creature, as well as man, to preſerve life by all means whatever they can attain: death, is an enemy to life, and is, as an enemy, ſhunned. That's a rare caſe and a kindly ſpirit indeed, that is ſo diſpoſed, as to deſire to be unclothed, ſo: which the Apoſtle denyes] not that we would be unclothed, but be clothed upon with a better clothing, to be changed for a better and a more durable clothing, incorruption, immortality, and life eternal, when and where, we ſhall not be found naked, that is, the tendency and earneſt deſire which the ſervants of God goes out after, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 54. of this 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the Apoſtle adds further, <hi>when this corruptible, hath put on incorruption, and this mortal, hath put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> [as it will at the time of the raiſing, and changing of the ſervants of God] <hi>then will be brought to paſſe</hi> [accompliſhed, and done fully] <hi>that which is written</hi> [Iſay 25. 8.] <hi>death is ſwallowed up in victorie;</hi> as mortalitie; ſhall likewiſe be of life, to wit, life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, compared 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. then the conqueſt and victory over death, will be brought to paſſe, and the righteous freed from being under his dominion any more, for ever: for then, they can dye no more: but be immortal, and live for evermore.</p>
                     <p>There are very many great things, as well as this victory over death, that do attend this time: very many, great, and high prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes contained in the ſcriptures, relating to that time, will, then, be fulfilled and made good: of which, ſomething ſhall be ſaid hereafter: yea, many of the prophecyes of holy <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> little minded or underſtood in this day: will, then be brought to paſſe, and made good, ſeem they never ſo ſtrange. It was ſo, at our Lord his firſt coming, as the holy ſcriptures do hold out unto us: as <hi>Math.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 44. with very many the like, which I ſhall forbear to ſet down. That of <hi>Luke,</hi> is the ſaying of our Lord Chriſt, very full: <hi>that all things that are written concerning me, in the law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and in the prophets, and in the Pſalms, muſt be fulfilled:</hi> not one jot, or tittle of the word of prophecy, as to things relating to the Lord Chriſt, and his kingdom: but it muſt all be fulfilled. As it was in relation to his <hi>firſt coming:</hi> ſo it will be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106759:31"/> alſo as to his <hi>ſecond coming, when he ſhall come in power and great glory:</hi> ſeem the things never ſo ſtrange, or unlikely; the power and faithfulneſs of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whoſe word it is, will make them good: of which, more hereafter. But for a cloſe, take we knowledge of one place more in holy <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> becauſe it is of like tone with what we have treated of, concerning clothing, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and putting on, and off.</p>

It ſeems, as to the laſt, and full fulfilling of it, to look at this bleſſed ſtate, and day, we are treating of, <hi>when the mariage of the lamb is come, and the bride, the lambs wife, is made ready; Rev.</hi> 19. 7. Likewiſe, that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 1. <hi>Ariſe, and ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi> All of like tendency and import: all prophetical, and eyeing a time, not yet come: and though it may, in a great meaſure, have its fulfilling before, and more eſpecially, when the Jewes are returned to their own land, and converted; yet no time ſo likely to have its full fulfilling, as then: when the Lord Chriſt ſhall come again: and the dead, in him, raiſed, and live again: and the then living ſaints, changed, in a moment; corruption, and all defilement, done away: and glory and honour, purity and holyneſs, immortality, and eternal life, put on: with beautiful and precious clothing. <hi>For Zion ſball then put on her beautiful garments, and ſhall ſhine very gloriouſly</hi> indeed; being ſo richly adorned, as a bride pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the bridegroom the Lord Jeſus; rich, and pure clothing then: without ſpot or wrinckle: and that will be found true, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, to the very life: <hi>thou art all fair, my love, and there is no ſpot in thee: cant.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                     <p>And then alſo will it be, that the Lord Chriſt, will preſent the Church [the bride, the lambs wife: the <hi>new Jeruſalem]</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a glorious Church, not having ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing: but holy, and without blemiſh: <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27. ſhe: namely, the Church, is accepted in the beloved, now: and fair and precious, as being clothed with his purity and righteouſneſs. All: now: in the ſtate of regeneration, and living by faith: is by imputation of his righteouſneſs: and as we are in him; the reckoning and account ſtands good, on the behalf of the ſervants of God: but then: that pure white linnen, ſaid, to be the righteouſnes of the ſaints: their own: ſo given unto them for their clothing, at their raiſing, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106759:32"/> changing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 8. It was granted to the lambs wife, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white: for ſo is it ſayd, the fine linnen, is the righteouſneſs of ſaints: <hi>they ſhall be like him when he appears. Their bodyes, that were vile, ſhall be made like his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body:</hi> very glorious, and ſhining: upon the whole, we may well ſay, with the ſpirit, and the bride: <hi>O come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> tells us, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 20. 21. of a very happy time: <hi>a time of refreſhing, from the preſence of the Lord:</hi> when God the father, ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord: he, that before, was preached unto them, that came in his humiliation, <hi>dyed for our ſins, roſe again, for our juſtification, aſcended into heaven, and is at the right hand of God, in glory:</hi> whom, the heavens muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (be the place of his ſtay, and abode) till then: namely, <hi>till that time of refreſhing come:</hi> and <hi>the time of the reſtitution, or reſtoration, of all things: that God hath ſpoken, by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, ſince the world began.</hi> This ſcripture comporteth in the tendency of it, with that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. being for matter and time much the ſame: As in like manner, this; of the changing, in a moment, the deſire and groaning of the creature, as well as the ſervants of God, that have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, as the earneſt of it, (to wit, that happy day) when they ſhall poſſeſs it; even <hi>their inheritance prepared for them.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                     <p>This groaning, and deſire, after reſtoration: this deſire of freedom, and the liberty of the ſons of God: ſeemeth to imply, a former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſtate, and condition, which they would be at, and enjoy again; to wit, that, which <hi>Adam</hi> was created in. He was created in the Image of God; a perfect man, in perfect freedom; from ſin, ſorrow, miſerie, and death: in full felicity: he ſinned, he fell; loſt his happy condition: and in him; all his poſteritie, and the creatures alſo: as:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106759:32"/> this: they groan under, and deſire to be rid of: ſo ſhall they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their expectation, be reſtored to their former eſtate, with ſome addition of bleſſedneſs: at that day of reſtoration, forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>Two wayes, this is attayned unto, as the holy ſcriptures do hold out unto us; the one, is by dying; and after lying a time in the grave: riſing again, or being raiſed out of the priſon of the grave, at the ſounding of the trumpet of God: when they ſhall, hear, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and riſe.</p>
                     <p>The other way is, by not dying, but being changed, in a moment, at the very ſame time, the dead are raiſed. This: change: is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: a ſecret: not much taken notice of. Theſe; both; at the ſame time, at the coming and appearing of the Lord Chriſt: will be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and changed, and caught up together in the clouds, to meet him in the air [not then to go up to heaven with him, but to attend him in his coming to the earth] and ſo will be ever after, with him, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſhall not prevent one another, by getting before one, the other: the raiſed, ſhall not ſo do, by the changed; nor ſhall they be occaſioned to ſtay for them: for they ſhall be changed, in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, and caught up together, Very aierie, and ſpriteful, ſhall they be, then. This change, or being changed: To: is a great thing indeed.</p>
                     <p>The change of regeneration: or being born again: which <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> made ſo ſtrange, and impoſſible a matter to be effected: to be born again, <hi>to put off the old man, with the affections and luſts; and to put on the new man, Ephes.</hi> 4. 22. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 8. 9. 10. <hi>The new man, being after God, created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs.</hi> It's a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite another perſon. A very great change, that hath much of miſtery in it. But the changing is a higher miſtery, a greater thing: the putting off ſin, and corruption, and mortality; at once; in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
                     <p>That, of regeneration, when begun by the ſpirit of Chriſt: it is carryed on, and advanced, in a gradual way; by the exerciſe of, mortification, and ſanctification, and by freſh ſupplies of the ſpirit of Chriſt, while we are in this world; till death, or this change, take place.</p>
                     <p>As we may, by that before, take ſome notice of this change: ſo we may alſo, of the neer affinitie it hath, with the reſurrection of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106759:33"/> the juſt; and how in ſundry things, they concur and agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to the righteous and ſaved people: who then, ſhall the one, be raiſed, the other, changed, at the ſame time, together. They ſhall both be rid, and freed of corruption, and mortality, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They ſhall both <hi>be caught up together, to meet the Lord in the aire:</hi> they ſhall be with the Lord Chriſt, together: they ſhall enjoy, glory, and honor, and eternal life, together: and the bleſſednes of that happy day, for ever.</p>
                     <p>The unjuſt, and wicked ſinners, they ſhall not ſhare at all, in the glory, and bleſſedneſs, of that happy day; for as they ſhall not riſe: then: that not being their order, or time of riſing: ſo ſuch of them, as are then living, ſhall not be changed, then, but ſhall be left in their old clothing of corruption, and mortalitie, they ſhall have no ſhare, or be concerned, in the bleſſedneſs of this miſtery, of being changed: ſo: for then: that of our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 40. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 34. 35. 36. will be made good, and fulfilled: <hi>at the coming of the ſon of man: then: two ſhall be in the feild: the one, ſhall be taken, the other left; Two women ſhall be grinding together, at the Mill; one ſhall be taken, the other left.</hi> The evangeliſt, <hi>Luke,</hi> holds it forth more largely, thus. I tell you, <hi>in that night, there ſhall be two men in one bed, the one ſhall be taken, the other ſhall be left.</hi> And as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Two grinding at the Mill: and two in the feild, ſo taken, and left. Vers.</hi> 37. Our Lord is asked; <hi>where, Lord?</hi> and he tells them in a dark borrowed way of ſpeaking; ſaying, <hi>whereſoever the body</hi> [or, carcaſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 28.] <hi>is, thither will the Eagles be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together.</hi> As if he had ſaid, where I am, thither ſhall mine, to wit, the raiſed, and changed ſaints, be gathered together. Conſider the demand: <hi>where, Lord?</hi> not where thoſe, ſo taken, and left, ſhall be, then: when they are ſo taken, and left: that our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared plainly: <hi>in the feild,</hi> and <hi>in the bed:</hi> but where thoſe, that are taken away, ſhould be, when they were ſo taken, from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, in the feild, and in the bed? they ſhould be taken, and brought to the Lord Chriſt, to meet him in the aire. This: that in <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 31. comp. with <hi>vers.</hi> 27. 28. ſeemeth very fully to hold forth.</p>
                     <p>When the Lord Chriſt ſhall come in the clouds of heaven, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and great glory, <hi>vers.</hi> 31. <hi>He ſhall ſend his Angels, with a great ſound of a trumpet</hi> [at which ſound, thoſe: dead; ſhall awake; and ariſe: and thoſe: living: ſhall be changed; in a moment. <hi>The trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi>

The ſervants of God, ſhall be very agile, aierie: and ſpriteful; and as the Eagles; ſhall mount up; ſo; to meet the Lord Chriſt.

                     <p>The holy ſcriptures declare. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. that God by Jeſus Chriſt, made the worlds; and by faith, we underſtand, and believe ſo: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. By ſaith we underſtand the worlds were framed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſcriptures make mention of three worlds: the old world, which began with the creation, and continued to the floud; and then pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and ended, ſo <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. This preſent world, ſo called in ſcripture, and may be ſo called ſtill; it took place with the ceaſing of the floud, and was peopled by <hi>Noah,</hi> and his ſons: and it continued and doth yet continue, is grown old and is reſerved (being grown old) unto fire, and the great burning to come, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. at the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men. <hi>The day of the Lord will come, vers.</hi> 12. and then will be the diſſolution and end of this preſent world. The Apoſtle expreſſeth it, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the earth that are now, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. As the ſame thing: to wit, this world, this preſent evill world. There is in the third place, the world to come, which will begin with the end or ceaſing of this preſent world, of which the holy ſcripture ſpeaks very often, ſo frequent, as I ſhall forbear quotations. When that end cometh, which will be with the burning ſpoken of: then will begin the world to come of which we are now treating; and ſhall mention a few places. <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 30. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. of which we may take notice hereafter: the time when: and how; this will contemporize with other great things that will take place likewiſe, then: to wit, at the coming of the Lord Chriſt, in power and great glory: to them that look for him the ſecond time; he will then appear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. This third world, this world to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106759:34"/> come; it will then begin. In the which the Lord Chriſt will fully take unto himſelf his great power, and will reign very gloriouſly: the dominion, power, and ſovereignty, will reſt in him, and he will then appear on earth, as king of kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
                     <p>Then, in the world to come, he will delegate power as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: to one to be ruler over five cities: and to another to be ruler over ten cities: they ſhall rule under him: yea: then: will they rule with him, and that be made good in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>And haſt made us kings and Prieſts unto our God, and we ſhall reign on the earth:</hi> it is not ſaid, <hi>in heaven;</hi> For the world to come; it will be here below on earth and not in heaven, above.</p>
                     <p>This world to come, it will not be <hi>ſubjected under the power of the Angels;</hi> the ſcripture expreſly tells us ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. as the other were: but it will be under the power of the Lord Chriſt and the ſaints. Then: their <hi>noble rulers will be of themſelves, and from among themſelves, Jer.</hi> 30. 21. This, and much more that might be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſeemeth very plainly to ſpeak forth, that, <hi>that the new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the new earth, wherein ſhall dwell righteouſnes,</hi> and the world to come; are much the ſame, and there is very little if any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all; both, beginning and taking place together at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Chriſt; and, both concurring in time, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the juſt: and the changing in a moment, the then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſervants of God; and other great things, that will be the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of that happy day.</p>
                     <p>Then, will theſe ſo raiſed, and changed, <hi>be caught up together, to meet the Lord,</hi> and they will be for ever with him in the world to come, and never ſevered from him any more. When the wicked ſhall be put from him, and bid <hi>depart.</hi> When the righteous ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy great bleſſednes and felicity: then according to that, which is a righteous thing with God: <hi>the wicked ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of, his power:</hi> even when <hi>he ſhall be glorified in his ſaints and admired in all them that believe.</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6. 9. 10. In the world to come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the righteous will be ſo happy and bleſſed, and the wicked ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and accurſed, we may a little take notice, what the world ſayeth; and we may begin with that of our Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 31. 32. where he tells us, that blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in that which is come:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106759:35"/> ſuch wicked ſinners as deſpite the ſpirit of grace, here, in this world: they ſhall not be forgiven: there is no more ſacrifice for them. Such wicked ſinners, as ſhall blaſpheme the ſpirit, and being under wrath, and puniſhment, blaſpeme the God of heaven whoſe judgments are all juſt: they ſhall not be forgiven then: in the world to come. The evangeliſt <hi>Mark. chap.</hi> 10. 30. He declareth the great reward the looſers for Chriſt ſake here, ſhall receive: then: in the world to come: as they ſhall alſo in this preſent world: in the world to come, they ſhall have everlaſting life: they ſhall have it, with all the good things, and great happines that attend that life. The evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> he tells us the ſame, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 30. The Lord Chriſt, will be high: then: his name highly advanced in the world to come: where he will ſet up his kingdom, and reign, fully: even, here, below on earth: in the new earth, among the righteous, who ſhall alſo reign with him then: and there: as it is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>And hath made us unto our God, kings, and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth.</hi> And: this: when the wicked, and unſaved of the nations ſhall be ſent away, and bid depart to their doleful places of aboad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. 46.</p>
                     <p>That will be made good, in the world to come: which is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Lord, in the parable, concerning <hi>Dives,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16. 19. 20. 22. 25. The wicked (for the moſt part) with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> have their good things in this world; and the righteous with poor <hi>Lazarus:</hi> they have affliction and ſorrow, evill things, but then in the world to come, it will be otherwiſe: the righteous will have the good things, the bleſſednes and the felicity; and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will have then in the world to come the evill things; as it is ſayd, <hi>ſon, remember that thou in thy life time, received thy good things, and likewiſe</hi> Lazarus, <hi>evill things; now he is comforted, and thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The world to come, where the righteous ſhall receive and enjoy everlaſting life: it will not be in heaven above, but it will be here below on earth: as the other world: The old world was ſo, and ſo is this preſent world, and ſo will be the world to come: in the earth, in the new earth; where our Lord Chriſt will be with his ſaints; when he cometh the ſecond time from heaven, where he now is and will be till the times of reſtitution or reſtoration of all things: <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 20. 21. and the new heavens and earth take place, and all things made new: when, and where, our Lord Chriſt will be with his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106759:35"/> ſaints, reigning with them a thouſand years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. 6. <hi>The new Jeruſalem, will come down from heaven,</hi> then: <hi>and the tabernacle of God</hi> [as of old] <hi>will be with men</hi> (where men will dwell then:) <hi>and God himſelf will be with them, and be their God, Rev.</hi> 21. 2. 3. <hi>and ſhall afterward be with him, in the ſecond, and laſt great ſeſſion of judgment, concluding their judging of wicked men, and be judging of Angels. Rev.</hi> 20. 1. 12. 13. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Jud. ver.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. 3. <hi>as is mentioned before.</hi> All this, and very much more, that might be ſet forth, will be in the world to come.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand as ſome do, that by the world to come; is meant heaven above; ſayd in holy ſcripture, to be the reſidence of the great <hi>Jehovah:</hi> ſeemeth to be a miſs-underſtanding, and a wrong applying of it; and the ſcriptures in all things relating to the world to come. To cry, heaven, heaven, as ſome ſeem to do, in all caſes and concerns relating to the world to come; as when men dye and are no more here in this world; it ſeemeth very much to dazel and darken the right underſtanding of the ſcriptures, in order to thoſe bleſſed promiſes and prophecys that relate to the future happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſervants of God in the world to come: and to be the means of raiſing an Idea or unknown thing in the mindes of men: as if in the world to come, men ſhould be Angels or little deities: and not men and women; as was <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and as many ſhould have been if he had continued in his firſt eſtate, and as men they will be and ſo converſe together in the habitable world to come.</p>
                     <p>To make all future things in order to the happyneſs and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men in the world to come, or new earth, then to be either in heaven or hell, and ſo to be meant; eſpecially taken properly and reſtrictively ſo: ſeemeth to be far from the drift and intent of the ſcriptures: rendring many things in them declared inſignificant, which do well agree with the habitable world to come: but not with heaven properly ſo underſtood.</p>
                     <p>The world to come, of which we have been ſpeaking: it will be new peopled with the raiſed and changed ſaints: wherein <hi>Iſrael, the ſeed of</hi> Abraham; <hi>a nation born in one day:</hi> will have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, being Gods nation: and the gentile ſaved nations, ſhall walk in their light, to wit, the light of the new <hi>Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21. 24. And then: will that be fully fulfilled, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. And ſo <hi>all Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, <hi>there ſhall come out of</hi> [or, to <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 59. 20.] <hi>Sion the deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlines from</hi>

                        <hi>Iacob:</hi> a great number! of which we ſhall ſpeak after.</p>
                     <p>Then: in the world to come: when the ſaints ſhall be ſo changed at the coming of our Lord Chriſt; will thoſe prophecyes be fully fulfilled, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>In thoſe dayes,</hi> and in that time, <hi>ſaith the Lord, the iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found,</hi> &amp;c. and that alſo. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>And I will remove the iniquity of that land, in one day, ſayth the Lord:</hi> both in the one, and the other; which, it is likely, will not ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in this world: but muſt be, in the world to come.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe miſtery ſhewed by the Apoſtle, touching the not dying, of the living ſaints, at the coming of our Lord Chriſt, but then changed in a moment, ſeemeth to be a very great thing; and to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much from that, of the reſurrection from the dead: and likewiſe, that there will be a difference, betwixt the raiſed, and the changed; though in many things, the raiſed, and thoſe ſo changed, will be alike, and the ſame; which will the eaſier appear if we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtate of man in paradiſe at his firſt creating; which ſeemeth, to be the very Image, and figure, of the ſtate and condition the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaints ſhall then be changed into, in a moment, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye: with ſome bleſſed additions of ſtabilitie, immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>This miſtery, of not dying; but being, ſo changed, ſeemeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much vailed and little minded; but as the ſame with the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead; which the holy Apoſtle ſpeaketh of as another diſtinct thing: <hi>behold, I ſhew you a miſtery:</hi> after he had ſpoken large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>As there will be much of likeneſs and oneneſs between the raiſed and changed, ſo there will be much of difference, as may be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106759:36"/> gathered from what the Apoſtle hath declared; and it is likely much of the miſtery lyeth in that: <hi>I ſhew you,</hi> [ſayth the Apoſtle] <hi>a miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: we ſhall not all dye but be changed in a moment;</hi> of which we ſhall make inquirie. And firſt, of that, wherein the raiſed and the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; will be the ſame, in their joynt attainers and enjoyments: and after we ſhall propoſe wherein they will diſſer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They will agree, and be joyntly the ſame; in the time of their riſing and changing together: at the appearing of the Lord, at the ſounding of the trumpet of God, the dead will then be raiſed, and the living changed in a moment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſhall be caught up, together in the clouds; and ſhall meet the Lord Chriſt together in the Air;</hi> being capacitated ſo to do.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They ſhall be with the Lord Chriſt,</hi> together, and never ſevered from him any more.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>They ſhall be</hi> both <hi>rid of corruption and mortalitie, and ſhall be clothed with incorruption and immortality and life everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. They ſhall both enjoy the world to come, and the happyneſs of it; dwell in the new earth, live and reign wirh the Lord Chriſt, then and there for a thouſand years; <hi>and afterwards ſhall be with him, the whole time, whileſt the ſecond, and laſt ſeſſion of judgement is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. They ſhall; both; enjoy the great bleſſedneſs, of that happy day: and the <hi>good things which God hath prepared for them that love him;</hi> and wait for the Saviour. Which good things: <hi>the eye hath not ſeen, nor the ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man</hi> to conceive, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They will: both: be without pain, ſorrow, or miſerie: <hi>and tears, will be wiped from their faces,</hi> and death, ſhall not meddle with them any more.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And to add no more, <hi>they ſhall both injoy the grace of the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or teſtament: God to be their God and they his people,</hi> in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner, then: and the grace of the new covenant, to keep them in that bleſſed condition for evermore.</p>
                     <p>Theſe raiſed and changed, ſo, although in many things they agree, and be the ſame in their attainers and enjoyments; yet they differ in ſome things, and that very conſiderable; and are not one and the ſame in all things; as the miſtery which the Apoſtle ſhews: which he declares with a <hi>behold,</hi> after his treating of the reſurrection, and raiſing of them from death, ſomething plainly doth implie: <hi>behold,</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:106759:37"/> 
                        <hi>I ſhew you a miſtery, we ſhall not all dye but be changed;</hi> and that alive, or living: which we may take notice of in the firſt place. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent way of attaining that happy eſtate and great injoyments in the world to come; it is by dying and lying in the grave and riſing again; and ſo that way freed from corruption; and clothed with incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and with glory, honor, and immortalitie, and eternal life: rich clothing indeed then.</p>
                     <p>But now, the changed: in a moment: alive without dying: it is clearly another way: living being alive without dying: they ſhall be ſo changed; as to put off, or to be rid of corruption: and to put on, and be clothed, with incorruption, immortalitie, and everlaſting life. This as a ground of the difference, whence many things will follow. Again, the raiſed; having once dyed: will riſe, and live again: but the changed will never dye nor live again, but be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a moment into a ſtate of incorruption, and immortality; as the Apoſtle tells us; <hi>we ſhall not all dye,</hi> but we ſhall all be changed.</p>
                     <p>The raiſed will not be the ſame (yet the ſame): not the ſame they were in body, as they were when they dyed; as the Apoſtle, <hi>vers.</hi> 37. 38. compared with <hi>vers.</hi> 42. God giveth to every ſeed his own body; though not the ſame as ſown: ſo, he ſayeth, <hi>is the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſown in weakneſs, raiſed in power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But the living, then, at Chriſts coming and the trumpets ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will have the ſame bodyes without dying; they will be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged being alive and living: corruption will be put off, and mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they reſtored to their firſt eſtate which they had and were created in <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe before his fall; when he ſuffered, and they ſuffer in him: the change then being ſo much for the worſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which theſe living then will be reſtored for the better, with ſome great addition of bleſſedneſs; into which perfect eſtate, according to what they were created, conſiſting in righteouſnes and holynes, will they be changed then, at that great change, and reſtoration of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. wherein, the ſons of God, that have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit as the earneſt thereof, will have the higheſt ſhare; beyond all earthly things, or creatures whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>The eyeing and well minding what man was before his ſin and fall may give ſome light in the caſe in hand: <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man and perfect woman, ſo made of God; little inferiour to the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. man and woman at the firſt making conſiſted of fleſh and bloud, bones and ſinewes, made up of ſeveral parts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106759:37"/> and members; with ſeveral ſenſes and faculties of ſoule, and body, which the poſteritie of <hi>Adam</hi> have and do enjoy unto this day; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have loſt the rectitude, and have by tranſgreſſion been clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with corruption and mortalitie; being deprived of the glory of God, his Image, holyneſs and righteouſnes, wherein at firſt they were created, and into which they ſhall be reſtored by being ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The regeneration in this world it hath a tendency unto this; but this changing in a moment: will fully effect it; and at that day, in the world to come it will be ſo fully and perfectly: ſo, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> changed for the worſe, and yet lived in the body, as they were made; ſo, thoſe of the ſervants of God, which live and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at the coming of the Lord, ſhall be changed for the better, and reſtored again to their firſt happy and perfect condition of body and ſoul, parts and members, ſenſes and faculties, as <hi>Adam</hi> then had, and his poſteritie yet have.</p>
                     <p>This miſtery of not dying; but being changed, living, in the body, it is a great thing in it ſelf, and great things (not much minded:) will neceſſarily follow. As namely, that this change and reſtoration are different and diſtinct things, and not one and the ſame with the reſurrection; but alſo that there will be, it is very likely, a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in condition and eſtate, betwixt them; and that thoſe of the reſurrection, will be of a higher degree then thoſe ſo changed.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle tells us of a difference in the celeſtial bodyes; and there will be alſo a difference in degree among the caeleſtial; the ſun, the moon, and the ſtars, are different in glory; yea, the ſtars differ in glory: ſo is the reſurrection, <hi>vers.</hi> 42. And it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable there will be difference between the raiſed and the changed: and that they will be different in degrees of Glory. The raiſed will be as the Angels of God, as our Lord ſayth, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 30. but the changed like to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> will be as the ſons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty: as they were in the regeneration; and as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were before the fall.</p>
                     <p>And theſe changed, ſo, and reſtored to their firſt condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dying, and living again, as the raiſed, it is likely, that as they will be reſtored to what <hi>Adam</hi> was, and likewiſe <hi>Eve,</hi> at their firſt making; ſo they will do the things which they did, or might have done, and enjoy the things which they did, or lawfully might do, in their innocent condition before corruption ſeized on them: of which we may treat ſomething afterward: the raiſed being reſtricted &amp; not in a condition ſo to do.</p>

                     <p>And becauſe ſome take no notice of the miſtery of this not dying but being changed alive; reckoning it, as the ſame thing with the reſurrection; without any difference, or diſtinction; and ſeem to ground it on that of our Lord his anſwer to the queſtion made to him; <hi>whoſe wife, the woman that had had ſeven husbands, whoſe wife ſhe ſhould be at the reſurrection? Seven having had her, Math.</hi> 22. 28. 29. we ſhall a little treat of it. To the queſtion ſo made, our Lord anſwereth; firſt, ſaying, <hi>they erred not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> Then further, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. he ſaith, <hi>in the reſurrection,</hi> [not in the changed] <hi>they neither marry, nor are given in marriage but are as the Angels of God in heaven:</hi> and ſo goeth on in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted way, as to the reſurrection: but as touching the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo, as in <hi>Mathew;</hi> there is nothing that includes the miſtery of the change: the evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> hath it more largely, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 34. <hi>the children of this world marry, and are given in Marriage: vers.</hi> 35. <hi>but they which ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,</hi> [to wit, the world to come] <hi>and the reſurrection from the dead,</hi> [the ſaying is reſtricted to them] <hi>neither marry, nor are given in marriage, vers.</hi> 6. neither can they dye any more; [having dyed once, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive cannot be mean tas including the changed; that ſhall not dye at all] <hi>for they are equal to the Angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the reſurrection:</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>of the changed:</hi> and further, he ſaith, <hi>vers.</hi> 37. <hi>now that the dead are raiſed,</hi> which doth not relate to the living; that ſhall not dye at all. This anſwer of our Lord, declared by both theſe evangeliſts, holds forth much; but ſeemeth to have nothing that relateth to thoſe alive at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord, who ſhall not dye, but be changed. So as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery holds it forth clearly to be another thing then the reſurrection: of which, the Apoſtle having ſpoken largely ſaith, <hi>behold, I ſhew you a miſtery, we ſhall not all dye; but be changed.</hi> He holds it forth, as another diſtinct thing: though ſomething like it, and related to it, in ſpeciall, in time, when they ſhall both be. That in <hi>Mathew,</hi> and likewiſe in <hi>Luke,</hi> relate to the reſurrection and the raiſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it wholy ſpeaks of them; and ſo it anſwereth the queſtion, <hi>whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be?</hi> firſt our Lord tells them, <hi>they erre not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſcriptures,</hi> then further he tells them, <hi>that in the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they marry not, nor are given in marriage but are as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> and ſo goeth on in that of the reſurrection. <hi>Luke,</hi> hath <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and giving in marriage, in this world:</hi> but denyeth it to thoſe,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106759:38"/> in the world to come; for then, they ſhall not do ſo: <hi>but be as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>neither can they die any more.</hi> Which the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged never did: and having put on immortality; can never do. He goeth on further, concerning the reſurrection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 37. ſee the place; and nothing will appear in a probable way, that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the miſtery of the changed people, as if it were one, and the ſame. And that they are two and not one, and differ greatly, as hath been ſayd; let that of the Apoſtle be conſidered, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>We that are alive, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep,</hi> [or dead] he ſpeaks ſo as of two diſtinct people: one dead the other alive, and that they ſhall not prevent one another; as ſome time it is found; as <hi>Jacob,</hi> prevented <hi>Eſau:</hi> but as in <hi>vers.</hi> 17. they ſhall be caught up together, as two different, and diſtinct people; though, as we ſaid: very like.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall end this chapter, and the eſſays therein propoſed; how largely the holy Apoſtle, having treated of the doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the order of it: and yet after all ſayd therein: ſayth, behold, I ſhew you a miſtery: a rare ſecret: not the things he had been ſpeaking of: but a caſe, wherein there ſhould be, not dying, or riſing again: but a changing: in a marvellous manner; in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye.

                     <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Containing, the holding forth, that the righteous living and remaining at the coming of the Lord Chriſt: changed in a moment.

                     <p>THat there will be a new earth: and an habitable world to come; ſomething hath been ſayd before: and that the righteous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, at the coming of the Lord; then, changed in a moment, ſhall be the inhabitants of it; not excluding the raiſed then living in the body again.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall now dilate a little, by way of enquirie; what the holy ſcriptures ſpeak, and hold forth concerning the ſame. Firſt, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 3. 13. ſpeaking of the hebrews, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106759:39"/> Jewes: who are ſaid, <hi>to be the firſt in order, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>To every man</hi> [found] <hi>working good, glory honor and peace; to the Jew firſt, and alſo</hi> [or after] <hi>to the gentile.</hi> It was ſo, in regard of the offer of grace and ſalvation: it is very like, it will be ſo then: <hi>Peter</hi> he ſayth, <hi>we, according to his promiſe, look for a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs,</hi> or righteous men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, according as the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 21. 22. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo ſhall be all righteous: they ſhall inherit the land for ever</hi> [to wit, the land of promiſe, the land of <hi>Canaan]: a little one ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong nation</hi> [a nation born in one day] <hi>I the Lord will haſten it in his time: when the redeemer ſhall come</hi> [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain] <hi>to</hi> Sion, <hi>and all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> which ſhall more fully be fulfilled at the time of their being ſo changed, in a moment, as declared by him. And on the other ſide, holy <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it,</hi> [to wit the holy city] <hi>any thing that defileth</hi> [or is unclean] <hi>neither whatſoever worketh aboma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or maketh a lie:</hi> but <hi>they which are written in the lambs book of life:</hi> thoſe ſhall dwell in Gods mountain, then, or his hill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 1. namely thoſe <hi>raiſed, and changed ones;</hi> not excluding the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the reſurrection. <hi>The Lord Chriſt ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather together his elect from the four winds from the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the earth, to the uttermoſt part of heaven, Mark.</hi> 13. 27. Very like to be made good in theſe changed ones, not excluding the raiſed. And that this will be made good then, ſee that in the fore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, <hi>And then ſhall they ſee the ſon of man coming in the clouds, with great power, and glory;</hi> comporting with this. And that, in a ſpecial wiſe, it relates to them, take we knowledge of that, in <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 6. 8. 9. 10. which as to its more full and through fulfilling, ſeems in my apprehenſion to eye that time. This ſeeing of the ſon of man at his coming, may minde us of that of our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 39. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth, till we ſhall ſay, bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: when every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which peirced him, Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                     <p>Further we may take notice what <hi>Ezekiel</hi> holds forth <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. In the 36th chapter, He declares the great diſpleaſure of God, againſt his people, the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſpeaks of great calamitie that had been upon them; the heathen people being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in Gods hand, who dealt cruelly with them: and that, <hi>when God hath pitty upon them, and returns to them, to take them again</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:106759:39"/> 
                        <hi>to be his people, then he would cauſe his fury againſt thoſe enemies to break forth, and they ſhould bear their ſhame and puniſhment:</hi> this from the 1. to the end of the 7th. <hi>vers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then followeth very high and great promiſes, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am for you, and will turn unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>And I will multiply men upon you; all the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>And I will multiply upon you, man and beaſt, and ſettle you after your old eſtates, and will do better unto you, then at your beginnings,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo goeth on to the 16th. <hi>verſe,</hi> in a promiſſary way. Where the prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins again a further relation of their ſin, and the wrath that attends: and the reaſon of the ſtop and ſtaying of their miſery; namely, the pitty, and compaſſion he had to them, and the regard he had to the honor of his great name. <hi>Vers.</hi> 24. God ſpeaks <hi>of gathering Iſrael from all countries, and bringing them to their own land, the iniquity of it being removed in one day.</hi> And <hi>vers</hi> 25. and 29. he ſpeaks of <hi>full cleanſing promiſed. vers</hi> 26. <hi>a new heart promiſed, and a new ſpirit to be given: the ſtony heart to be taken away, and a heart of fleſh given.</hi> [cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption wholly put off, and incorruption put on: a great change, indeed; much the ſame we are treating of] <hi>vers.</hi> 27. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes. Verſe</hi> 28. <hi>And ye ſhall dwell in the land, that I gave to your fathers,</hi> [which land ſhall have the iniquity of it, removed in one day]. <hi>And ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God:</hi> The fulneſs of the bleſſing of the new covenant. See what followeth to the end of the chapter and weigh the whole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chapter</hi> 37. Firſt, we have that of the <hi>dry bones, ſet together with fleſh and ſynews, and covered with skin, and life breathed into them,</hi> with the interpretation of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. Theſe bones, are the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The opening of graves, as to the full, or utmoſt fulfilling of it, ſeemeth to eye the reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>We have likewiſe, the two ſticks, made one: to wit, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> made one, as <hi>vers.</hi> 17. explained in <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <hi>behold, I will take the children of Iſrael from among the heathen whither they be gone, and will gather them on every ſide, and bring them into their own land, vers.</hi> 22. <hi>And I will make them one nation in the land upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Iſrael, and one king ſhall be king to them all: and they ſhall no more be two nations, neither ſhall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.</hi> Then in <hi>vers.</hi> 23. There is the promiſe of preſervation from pollution: the promiſe of full cleanſing; of full ſalvation
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106759:40"/> and being kept in that happy condition they were changed into: and God to be their God, and they his people. And, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 24. <hi>David,</hi> Gods ſervant, to be king over them, and they to have one ſhepheard.</p>
                     <p>Then followeth, that very obſervable, and remarkable <hi>vers</hi> 25. <hi>And they ſhall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, wherein your fathers have dwelt</hi> [to wit, the land of <hi>Canaan] and they ſball dwell therein, even they and their children, and their childrens children for ever, and my ſervant</hi> David <hi>ſhall be their prince for ever.</hi> We may take knowledge of the great thing in <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. and to the end of the chapter: as firſt, <hi>a covenant of peace, God will make with them</hi> then, [for a thouſand years only? no:] it ſhall be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, comporting with <hi>Pſa.</hi> 72. 7. <hi>In his days ſhall the righteous flouriſh: and abundance of peace, ſo long as the moon endureth:</hi> God <hi>will ſet his ſanctuary in the midſt of them for evermore.</hi> And as <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>He will have his Tabernacle amongſt them, as ſometime he had of old, wherein the glory of God was, and a cloud covering of it;</hi> and as it ſhall be when the new heavens and the new earth take place; which holy <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3. holds forth with a <hi>behold,</hi> as a great thing: <hi>behold the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God is with men;</hi> relating to the ſame time: a great thing, for God to dwell with men on earth, as once he did, and will do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain then: and further, <hi>God be their God, and they his people,</hi> in a very eminent manner, which crowns the whole. And then, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 28. <hi>The heathens</hi> [the unſaved of the nations] <hi>ſhall know Gods favour and goodneſs to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and that it is he that doth ſanctifie them, when his ſanctuary ſhall be in the midſt of them for evermore.</hi> In <hi>chap.</hi> 36. 11. God ſayth, <hi>he will do better for them then at their beginning:</hi> when they enjoyed ſo great things by vertue of his preſence with them: ſo as this prophecy clearly relates to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and by any thing yet appearing; it hath never been made good and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſince <hi>Ezekiells</hi> time. There was never ſuch gathering, and bringing out of their graves: never ſuch uniting, as one nation: nor have they had ſince his time, one king over them ſo united. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> [to wit, Chriſt] Gods ſervant, hath never been king or prince over them: never did they enjoy ſuch an happy and bleſſed eſtate: never did they and their children, and their childrens children dwell in the promiſed land for ever: neither was Gods ſanctuary and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle planted in the midſt of them, ſince <hi>Ezekiels</hi> time, to this day. All muſt be fulfilled and made good, ſo declared by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:106759:40"/> without the leaſt fayler. And although much of this may be fulfilled before, and more eſpecially when the Jewes are returned to their own land and converted, yet there is no time ſo likely for it to have its full and utmoſt fulfilling, as at the coming of the redeemer, <hi>When all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved:</hi> at that happy time of the reſtoration of all things, which God hath ſpoken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the time of the new earth, the dwelling of the righteous, and ſaved people: in the world to come; wherein there will be incorruption, and immortalitie, and everlaſting life. And if any ſhall think, it may have its fulfilling ſooner, even in this day and in this world, and eſpecially before the time comes of the Jewes return and converſion, and ſhall think to make it out by allegoriſing, and a ſpiritual meaning, and ſaying, that all, or moſt of this is come, and done already, within them; ſo drawing a vale over this great prophecy, it will ſignifie little: for that no happy attainer ſooner, will any wayes hinder the full and final fulfilling then: all other fulfillings falling ſhort of that time, in compariſon will be imperfect, and one jot, or title muſt not fail thereof.</p>
                     <p>That in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. ſeemeth very much the ſame, and to comport with what we have been treating of before; concerning the changed in a moment: and theſe ſo ſealed; as likely to be one and the ſame: and concurring alſo in the time, in order to the things attending the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Chriſt; and in holding forth the firſt-ſhip or prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is declared, that <hi>an Angel having the ſeal of the living God:</hi> [the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us what that ſeal is, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.] this Angel <hi>vers.</hi> 2. he cryeth to the <hi>Four Angels appointed to hurt the earth, to forbear the doing of it, till he had ſealed the ſervants of God in their forheads:</hi> ſo, as being ſealed [or marked] in their foreheads, they thus might be known, at leaſt, to the Angels that were to hurt the earth. The words are, <hi>hurt not the earth, neither the ſea, nor the trees</hi> [the words are ſhort, but very comprehenſive] <hi>till we have ſealed the ſervants of our God in their foreheads.</hi> This hurting the earth, in my apprehenſion, is likely to relate to that great burning ſpoken of at the end of the world, and the judgements that ſhould attend it, before and after: it being like the proceed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>of marking the mourners, before the going forth of the Angel to deſtroy.</hi> And being compared with that, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4. It will inform us where and when this ſealing and marking will be, <hi>In the earth, at the great burning of</hi>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:106759:41"/> 
                        <hi>the then world, at the coming of the Lord Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the reſtoration, and new earth,</hi> as before.</p>
                     <p>Holy <hi>John. Vers.</hi> 4. Having heard the number; declares it, to be <hi>One hundred and fourty and four thouſand,</hi> in the whole ſum of them ſo ſealed, or marked, to be as before. And that number was made up of all the tribes of <hi>Iſrael: twelve thouſand of every tribe:</hi> wherein, there is much of union: one nation then: and there is much of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litle: it ſeemeth to eye that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> about the dividing the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance by <hi>Lot,</hi> in the holy land, to all the tribes, as ſet forth, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. very conſiderable: but dark as yet: and alſo it ſpeaks forth, that preheminence will be to <hi>Iſrael</hi> Gods nation: they as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and his family, were of the old world, and were reſerved, to be the firſt inhabitants of this preſent world: ſo thoſe then ſealed and not dying but living, are thoſe that ſhall be the inhabitants of, and have preheminence (above the gentile believers, then living and changed and alſo partakers thereof) in the world to come: and ſo be alive in both, as <hi>Noah,</hi> and his family were. Not hereby exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the raiſed ſaints from their great intereſt and ſhare therein, then: it being ſayd, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>After this I beheld, and to, a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which no man could number</hi> [hapily the gentle believers then changed: and all that have ſlept in Chriſt ſince the creation, and fall] <hi>of all nations, and kinreds, and people, and tongues, ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne, and before the lamb, clothed with white Robes,</hi> [they had changed, and put off the old robes of corruption: and put on new, of incorruption, and purity] <hi>and had Palms in their hands.</hi> [Much felicity, and abundance of peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 7.] and as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>They cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, ſalvation to our God, which ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the ſealed ones we reade again in the 14th. chapter <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>And I looked, and lo, a lamb</hi> [to wit, the Lord Chriſt] <hi>ſtood on the mount Sion</hi> [whether the redeemer will come] <hi>and with him an hundred, fourty and four thouſand, having his fathers name written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi> By the way, we may take knowledge, that ſealing on the forehead, and writing on the forehead, and marking on the foreheads are one, and the ſame. <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. <hi>and I heard a voice from heaven</hi> [for the company were on earth:] much joy and gladnes manifeſted by them: for, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>They ſang as it were a new ſong before the throne, and before the four Beaſts</hi> [or living creatures] <hi>and the elders;</hi> in that great aſſembly, of the one hundred fourty and four thouſand, ſo
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106759:41"/> ſealed; and having the fathers name written in their foreheads. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which were redeemed from the earth, <hi>being found alive at the coming of the Lord Chriſt,</hi> according to the miſtery ſhewed by holy <hi>Paul.</hi> It is not ſayd, <hi>out of their graves,</hi> but <hi>from the earth,</hi> where the burning was: as to that of coming forth of the grave, ſee that of our Lord; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28. 29. <hi>All that are in the graves ſhall come forth.</hi> The ſong that they ſung, none could learn, but they, and haply ſuch as they were. The cauſe or reaſon, why they could not, I ſhall forbear by way of aſſay to ſhew: it is ſayd, <hi>none could learn that ſong:</hi> haply not ſo as to expreſſe it, not ſo as to underſtand it or ſing it; it being a peculiar, like the <hi>white ſtone, with the new name in it, which none knows but they that have it:</hi> it being a peculiar to himſelf, that hath it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>vers.</hi> 4. There is a deſcription of them, <hi>they are ſuch, as were not defiled with women:</hi> the corruption that came by <hi>Eve</hi> and all her daughters: they were rid of, and freed from; having put off cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. They are ſaid to be virgins, in a pure virgin ſtate. And they are ſuch <hi>as attend the lamb, and follow him whitherſoever he goeth.</hi> As in his providences, keeping faithful to him and his truths before: ſo when he is come down among men on earth the ſecond time, in power and great glory. Further, it is ſaid, <hi>theſe were redeemed from among men.</hi> As from the fear and favour of men before: ſo hapily, at the burning, being marked, or ſealed for preſervation: taken, <hi>one of two in the field: at the mill:</hi> (women, as well as men) <hi>and in the bed:</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>one ſhall be taken and the other left,</hi> being, it may be, ſealed, or marked in the foreheads before; a very great thing! And they are ſaid to be <hi>the firſt-fruits to God and to the lamb:</hi> the <hi>firſt-fruits to God;</hi> of his bleſſed deſigne, of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome of <hi>Adams</hi> fallen poſteritie to their former happy eſtate and condition, then fully perfected and finiſhed, for his praiſe and glory; that, as his ſervants they ſhould ſerve him. They are the <hi>firſt-fruits to the lamb:</hi> namely, <hi>of the travel of his ſoul, Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. In his great humiliation he took on him the firſt-fruits of his purchaſe, and full redemption: the firſt fruits of his conqueſt, and <hi>ſaving to the uttermoſt, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. So as that may be minded here as being then fully fulfilled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10.

To conclude, it is very probable, that the world to come, will be here below; on earth.

                     <p>SOmething hath been ſaid before, concerning the great things that attend the coming of the Lord Chriſt, and come to paſſe then: as the reſtoration of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>A new heaven, and a new earth:</hi> the raiſing the dead ſaints out of their graves: the changing the living in a moment: the beginning of the world to come: with other things, very many, that have been mentioned before, and may be further ſaid after; that are held forth in the prophecies, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the holy ſcriptures, relating to the latter day, not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, nor like to be in the full made good, till that happy day, in that bleſſed world to come: of which we ſhall dilate a little.</p>
                     <p>In the former chapter, we treated of what <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath foretold. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. Of the <hi>dry bones,</hi> and the <hi>two ſtiks:</hi> with the interpretation of the ſame. The matter relating to <hi>Iſraels</hi> reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and re-union: and their full enjoyments of the promiſes made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> which had not been made good in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> his time; but were, after, to be fully made good, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he declared: which, to this day, hath not been made good; and not very likely, ſo fully to be ſo, in any time yet to come, in this world: but much more probable, to be made good then, to the full, when that nation ſhall be ſo born in one day; and be no more two, but one nation for ever: <hi>they, and their Childrens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for ever: at that bleſsed day, when the world to come ſhall take</hi>

                        <hi>place;</hi> when that, of the redeemers coming to <hi>Sion,</hi> and to ſuch <hi>as turn</hi> [or are turned] <hi>from iniquity in Jacob,</hi> hath its full fulfilling: which is not very like to be, till the Lord himſelf comes: for he himſelf hath ſaid: <hi>ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth, till the time come when ye ſhall ſay, bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, Luk.</hi> 23. 35.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The lambs ſtanding on Mount Sion with the ſealed ones having their fathers name written on their foreheads;</hi> and the <hi>ſinging the new ſong which none could learn but they:</hi> that pure virgin ſtate: and <hi>being without fault before the throne of God:</hi> it will not I conceive be ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this world; but in that bleſſed world to come. All thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned things, will very fully contemporiſe with that bleſſed time, and ſtate; without any allegorie, interpretation, or framing a ſpirituall notion to make the matter good: for it will be even ſo, in the letter, viſibly, and be made good, without the leaſt failer.</p>
                     <p>Further, that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is very conſiderable as to this matter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 65. 17. where the <hi>new heaven and the new earth,</hi> is held forth with a <hi>behold;</hi> a great thing, <hi>behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth. vers.</hi> 18. <hi>I create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a joy.</hi> And therefore in the beginning of the <hi>vers.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>be glad and rejoyce for ever, in that which I create, for behold, I create:</hi> a very great thing! ſo he goeth on to the end of chapter. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 8. <hi>Who hath heard ſach a thing? ſhall a nation be born at once?</hi> [in a moment in the twinkling of an eye; as thoſe alive, at the coming of the Lord; ſhall be changed then] <hi>As ſoon as Sion travelled ſhe brought forth;</hi> ſee the whole, to the 22. <hi>vers.</hi> And that in ſpecial in the 14. 15. 16. See if they do not eye the very time of the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this world by fire, and the taking place of the bleſſed world to come; when the new heaven, and the new earth will take place; of which before. And the certainty, and ſtableneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. For <hi>as the new heavens, and the new earth which I ſhall make, ſhall remain before me, ſaith the Lord; ſo ſhall your ſeed and your name remain.</hi> This comporteth with that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. very conſiderable: <hi>As for me this is my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, ſaith the Lord, my ſpirit that is upon thee</hi> [being changed ſo] <hi>and my words which I have put in thy mouth</hi> [to wit, of thanksgiving and praiſe] <hi>ſhall not depart out of them mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from henceforth, and for ever.</hi> And this, I conceive, relateth to the coming of the redeemer to <hi>Sion;</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:106759:43"/> when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. then, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 1. <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and ſhine for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee. Jeruſalems</hi> happy day will then be come. We might mention much more of holy <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> for that he had great light in this matter, and hath held forth much, as in <hi>chap.</hi> 60. and ſo, to the end of his prophecy, which the reader may pleaſe to conſider. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in divers other places, which I forbear to mention, leſt we ſhould be too large. All that hath been ſaid, as to its full fulfilling, ſeemeth to relate to the time, of the world to come; and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> principally; not excluding the gentile Saints from ſharing in the bleſſedneſs of that day, and walking in <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> light; when, it ſhall be very great indeed. The light of one day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſun; then; as the light of ſeven dayes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 26. that that changing, in a moment; will effect it to the higheſt degree of being tranſlated out of darkneſs, into this marvelous light, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, we may take notice, what the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> holds forth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 31. and 32. of which we ſhall dilate a little. <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 10. <hi>Iacob</hi> is bidden, not to fear, nor <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be diſmayed; for God will ſave them from afar, and their ſeed from the land of their captivitie, and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhall return and be in reſt and quiet, and none ſhall make him afraid: he goeth on, with further promiſes and threatnings againſt the wicked, then; at the ſame time, to wit, in the latter days, when God will perform the intents of his heart; reade on to the 22th. <hi>verſe,</hi> where he ſums up all; <hi>and they ſhall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I will be their God;</hi> very happy will their condition be; for <hi>bleſſed is the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 1. he ſaith, <hi>at the ſame time, will I be the God of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and they ſhall be my people.</hi> In an eminent wiſe they ſhall be ſo to God, and he ſo to them; a very great thing! the one hundred forty and four thouſand of all the tribes of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thoſe ſealed ones; with their fathers name written on their foreheads, will be ſo Gods people, and God their God ſo. The twelve thouſand of every tribe and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the coming of the deliverer to <hi>Sion;</hi> and the two ſticks, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion and the interpretation of it; one nation; and no more two for ever: but one born in a day; changed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: then will God be their God and they his people, ſo, at that day. So he goeth on, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>I will build thee, and thou ſhalt be built, O virgin of Iſrael, vers.</hi> 6. there ſhall be a day, wherein it ſhall be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106759:44"/> ſaid, <hi>ariſe ye, and let us go up to</hi> Sion, <hi>to the Lord our God,</hi> vers. 7. <hi>the Lord ſaith, ſing with gladneſs for</hi> Jacob. vers. 8. <hi>behold, I will bring them from the north, and gather them from the coaſts of the Earth.</hi> vers. 10. <hi>he that ſcattered</hi> Iſrael <hi>will gather him, and keep him as a ſhepheard doth his ſheep,</hi> or flock, vers. 11. <hi>the Lord hath redeemed</hi> Jacob. vers. 12. therefore ſhall they come and ſing in the height of <hi>Sion:</hi> for <hi>Sion</hi> will be very high indeed then; and ſhine forth very gloriouſly, this is much the ſame with that of holy <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 2. 2. When; <hi>it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt days</hi> [the very time we are treating of] <hi>that the mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the hills, and all nations ſhall flow unto it.</hi> He goeth on, and ſpeaketh of great things that ſhall be done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Gods people. At <hi>vers.</hi> 31. He ſpeaketh of a new covenant, God will make after thoſe days, with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi> Reade the matter at large.</p>
                     <p>What it is: he declares, <hi>vers.</hi> 33. of <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. Namely, <hi>he will put his law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and he will be their God, and they ſhall be his people.</hi> There is much of grace in it, in that he undertakes to do it, without any condition: <hi>vers</hi> 34. Seemeth to look further, and to eye another time, then that of grace and the ſtate of regeneration, as to its full fulfilling; it is ſaid, <hi>they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour; and every man his brother; ſaying, know the Lord,</hi> [the reaſon is] <hi>For they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This new covenant, it ſeemeth not only to eye the day of grace, but the day of glory. Not only the day of Chriſts firſt coming, when he confirmed it with his bloud. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. The comfort, and bleſſed fruit whereof, all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, in all ages ſince, have enjoyed and yet do and ſtill ſhall enjoy, till that happy time come, when they ſhall enjoy the high and full enjoyment of it, in that bleſſed world to come: when the great fruit and bleſſedneſs of it ſhall then be made partakers of; ſo as was never attained unto, or enjoyed before; in that happy time that is coming, it will have its full fulfilling, and be made good in every particular. That in <hi>vers.</hi> 34. of this <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. which ſeemeth to eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time in order thereunto: for in the day of grace, whileſt this world laſteth, there will be need of teaching and exhorting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it is commanded <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. But <hi>exhort one another dayly, whileſt it is called to day,</hi> (whileſt the day of grace laſteth) ſo <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 25. But exhort one another, and ſo much the more, as we ſee the day
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106759:44"/> approacheth; wherein there will be no need of doing it. Here, in the ſtate of regeneration there will be but knowledge in part; but then, in that happy ſtate, and time, there will be the full viſion and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, that man will be capable of: the greateſt according to the greatneſs; and the leaſt, according to their littleneſs: every veſſel, bigg or little, will be brim-full, that it can receive no more: <hi>The earth</hi> (to wit, the new earth) <hi>will be full of the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the ſea. Iſa.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
                     <p>Holy <hi>Paul</hi> ſemeth to eye this, of not teaching one another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>we know but in part, we propheſy in part:</hi> ſo was it at the preſent: but there was another time to come, when it would not be ſo. <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. When that which is perfect is come, that bleſſed time, that perfect ſtate takes place, as it will do when the raiſed and changed ones ſhall appear with the Lord Chriſt: then an end of things in part; and of teaching alſo: For propheſying or teaching <hi>as to them,</hi> will then ceaſe. Here we are but as children, then as perfect men: here we ſee but as through a glaſſe, darkly; but then we ſhall ſee face to face, clearly and fully: we now know but in part, but then, we ſhall know as we are known: for God will fully take away the face of the covering and vail, that lets and hinders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 7. when there ſhall be a changing ſo, that vail will be done away. Very high knowledge of God then: our Lord will ſhew us plainly of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in him we ſhall behold his glory.</p>
                     <p>In the eighth and ninth chapters of the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> this is treated of by the Apoſtle, under the term of a new teſtament. A covenant and a teſtament differ ſomething, ſtrictly minded; though in ſubſtance they may be the ſame. There were many covenants made by Almighty God: as with <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> with the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> and with <hi>Levi, &amp;c.</hi> But he made but two teſtaments; a firſt by <hi>Moſes;</hi> confirmed by the bloud of Bulls, and Goats. A ſecond, by the Lord Chriſt; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his own bloud, or death, as a teſtament muſt be; elſe it is of no force: but a covenant is of force whileſt a perſon liveth, and is otherwiſe confirmed. The new teſtament; as a teſtament of the Lord Chriſt; he is the bleſſed mediator or ſurety of it, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> was of the firſt. It relates chiefly to the time of grace, and the eſtate of regeneration, in this world; and is of high concern; and great fruit and benefit to all believers; much of the miſtery of godlines, and of the Goſpel being contained in it: but as a covenant, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106759:45"/> to eye and look at a further time not yet come; and a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that ſhall then be made good, when they ſhall not teach; for there will be no need of it; they ſhall know as much as they ſhall be capable of knowing: for ſuch fullneſs they ſhall enjoy as nothing can be added to it.</p>
                     <p>No great queſtion but the Apoſtle had this in his thoughts, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that bleſſed time to come; the laſt verſe ſeemeth to ſpeak out ſo much; <hi>to them that look for him,</hi> [to wit, the Lord Chriſt] <hi>ſhall he appear the ſecond time</hi> [as he appeared the firſt] <hi>without ſin</hi> [to wit, the imputation of ſin; in a low condition, in the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſo the firſt time: but the ſecond time, in power and great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; without ſin] <hi>unto ſalvation, Heb.</hi> 9. 28. to wit, to full, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſalvation of body and ſpirit united in one, at that happy day. There are many bleſſed expectants that look for the Lord Chriſt his appearing, this ſecond time: as good old <hi>Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Hannah,</hi> did the firſt time: there are bleſſed ſervants that look for their Lord his return from a far country, whither he is gone to receive for himſelf a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to come again <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 12. There are many virgins, that wait with oyl in their lamps for the bridegrooms coming, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. To them that look for him the ſecond time, he will appear, to their great joy and conſolation: the ſpirit and the bride, ſay come, O come Lord Jeſus come quickly.</p>
                     <p>Further; in the new covenant, ſpoken of by holy <hi>Ieremiah:</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſins no more:</hi> ſo forgiven, and ſo forgotten, as never before: no further need of an advocate then in caſe of ſin, for that will be fully made good then in <hi>Ier,</hi> 50. 20. <hi>In thoſe dayes, and at that time, the iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and they ſhall not be found,</hi> &amp;c. Then will be the time when the Church will be preſented glorious, without ſpot or blemiſh, or wrinckle, or any ſuch thing, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27. And that true really, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imputation, <hi>Thou art fair, thou art fair my love, and there is no ſpot in thee: Cant.</hi> 4. 1. 7.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in this new covenant, or teſtament; as that which makes good all, it is ſaid; <hi>and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> In a very high and eminent wiſe, it will be ſo then; beyond what before: a very great and bleſſed thing: this is ſtill mentioned as the cloſe: to have God, in a ſpecial wiſe to be their God: and for a people to be ſo related to God, as to be his people in a peculiar
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106759:45"/> way, is a great thing, and that which renders them conſiderable and happy, and bleſſed indeed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 15. Thoſe ſealed ones, having their fathers name written on their foreheads; I conceive, compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in time, and being the ſame with thoſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſhall ſerve him, and ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their foreheads.</hi> He that ſitteth on the throne, ſayeth, theſe words are true and faithful, that it relates to that bleſſed time, in order to the high and full fulfilling of it; we may minde that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. where the new heaven and the new earth is ſpoken of, as <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn ſaw a new heaven and a new earth. Vers.</hi> 2. He ſaw the new Jeruſalem come down from heaven, very glorious. As he ſaw, ſo he heard alſo; <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>A great voice out of heaven,</hi> it is, with a <hi>behold the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> And as <hi>vers.</hi> 4. And <hi>God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes:</hi> all ſorrow, and pain and death it ſelf, ſhall be done away and be no more; and all things ſhall be made new; and <hi>Iohn</hi> is bidden <hi>to write,</hi> for that <hi>theſe ſayings are faithful and true, vers.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. <hi>vers.</hi> 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. The prophet ſpeaketh again, of the Lord his gathering of them out of all countryes, and bringing them again; comporting, as to the full fulfilling of it, with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels gathering the elect from the four windes, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 31. And making an everlaſting covenant with them, and doing great things for them; and that he will be their God, and they ſhall be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And that he will plant them in their own land aſſuredly; and do it with his whole heart, and ſoul: as, before he ſpake of the fureneſs of his covenant; as ſure, as the ordinances of heaven, their abiding ſtable; to wit, the ſun and moon, and the ſtars.

                     <p>I ſhall adde a few teſtimonies out of the following prophets, that are of the like import, and tendency, with what hath been held forth before, and ſhall begin with <hi>Daniel chap.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>At that time, ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, the great prince,</hi> [very likely to be the Lord Chriſt, the prince of peace: when he appeareth again, great things will take place: he will ſtand for <hi>Daniels</hi> people, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto whom he came before, but they received him not; at that time] <hi>there will be ſuch trouble as never was before:</hi> and at that time, <hi>Daniels</hi> people ſhall be delivered: they ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the great deliverer, when he ſhall come to <hi>Sion, Rom.</hi> 11. 26.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106759:46"/> As before is mentioned. <hi>The Lord Chriſt, ſball ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather his elect from the four windes Math.</hi> 24. 31. <hi>They ſhall be delivered every one of them,</hi> (not one left behinde) <hi>of thoſe, that ſhall be found written in the book, (of life,</hi> it is like, it is meant). The lamb, the Lord Chriſt, hath a book of life, wherein is written the names of his, from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 8. Much comporting with the promiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 5. 12. To thoſe that are overcommers. And it ſhews further what time this relates unto, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3. 4. It will be, when there ſhall be no more curſe: but the throne of God and of the lamb, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their foreheads; when they ſhall reign for ever: <hi>vers.</hi> 5. At that time, when the Lord Chriſt cometh, and the dead are raiſed, and the living ſaints changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye: it ſhall be fully made good, and, it is likely, not before.</p>
                     <p>Further, in <hi>vers.</hi> 2. of this <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. He ſpeaketh of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſaying, <hi>many that ſleep in the duſt,</hi> [to wit, in their graves] <hi>ſhall ariſe, ſome to everlaſting life</hi> [to wit, of felicity, and enjoying God and Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their names being in the book of life] <hi>and ſome to ſhame, and everlaſting contempt.</hi> As it is ſaid elſewhere; <hi>To everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord;</hi> into everlaſting puniſhment; everlaſting; there is, in order to both; according to that of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Then; will be great glory, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs, to the juſt: and great woe, and miſery to the wicked. The parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſpeaks forth this very plainly: the righteous will then ſhine gloriouſly; though now they are made black with reproach. Good <hi>Daniel,</hi> was inquiſitive about this; and the time when it ſhould be? he is bidden, as in the laſt verſe, by the Angel to go his way till the end, [I conceive, of this world, as if he ſhould have ſaid, then it ſhall be; and in a promiſſary way, it is ſaid] <hi>thou ſhalt reſt,</hi> [to wit, in his grave, as in a bed] and ſtand up in thy lot [to wit, be raiſed again] in the end of the days, to enjoy his lot or ſhare of glory, then: much the ſame with that in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 23. 24. Every man in his own order: firſt, Chriſt, then thoſe that are Chriſts at his coming. The wicked dead: in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or time; a thouſand years after.</p>
                     <p>In the next place; take we notice, what the prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſayth, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 1. 7. where the Lord ſayeth, <hi>he will ſave Iudah, not by bow, or ſword,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by the Lord their God.</hi> Haply, by changing them,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106759:46"/> in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. He ſaith, yet <hi>the number of the children of Iſrael, ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be numbred;</hi> and where it was ſaid, <hi>ye are not my people:</hi> there it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>ye are the ſons of the living God.</hi> Vers. 11. <hi>Then ſhall the children of Iſrael gather themſelves together; and appoint themſelves one head;</hi> for great ſhall be the day of <hi>Jezreel:</hi> which hath never yet been made good, nor is it very likely to be ſo, to the full, till that happy day and time we have often mentioned take place.</p>
                     <p>I might improve to the ſame account, that of the prophet <hi>Amos, chap.</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. 14. 15. That of the prophet <hi>Obadiah. vers.</hi> 17. to 21. That of the prophet <hi>Micha, chap.</hi> 4. 13.

All ſure, and ſtable; and one jot, or tittle of it ſhall not fail.</p>
                     <p>So, as upon the whole we may with great probabilitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that thoſe great propheſyes forementioned, and that new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; extend to the time of the coming of our Lord Chriſt, the ſecond time; when they will be all made good to the full, to thoſe believers found alive, and changed in a moment, then: and be made the inhabitants of the new earth, and world to come.</p>
                     <p>That many things contained in them, are incompatible with the ſtate of regeneration in this world: but as to their utmoſt fulfilling, will fitly ſute and agree, without any allegorie, or ſpiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put on them, they will agree and ſute, with thoſe ſo changed in a moment: inhabiting the new earth and world to come.</p>
                     <p>That thoſe prophecyes and the new covenant, do in a ſpecial wiſe, appertain to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to whom do appertain the promiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4.

                     <p>AS the new covenant, and thoſe high and great promiſes and propheſyes in the old Teſtament, will have their great and utmoſt fulfilling in the world to come, at the coming of the Lord Chriſt in the new earth: ſo, in like manner, will many prophecies, promiſes, and bleſſed ſayings, in the ſcriptures of the new Teſtament then; be fulfilled, and made good alſo; whatever fulfilling, in a degree, they may have had before in the day of grace, Then, there will be full redemption, full ſalvation to the utmoſt: full freedom, and very glorious liberty of the children of God. There will be full reſtoration from their corrupt and fallen condition in <hi>Adam</hi> to a perfect rectitude. Full deliverance from ſin, and death, and the grave; with full enjoyment of God, and the Lord Chriſt; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the holy Angels, and ſaints of the moſt high God: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> the holy prophets, and martyrs; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtles of the lamb; with all the juſt men made perfect; Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with full bleſſedneſs, felicitie, and joy; and that without any ſorrow, grief, or pain; together with immortality, and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, in the enjoyment of all thoſe high enjoyments, and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the full, beyond conceiving. As it is written, the eye hath not ſeen, nor the ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. All which, ſhall be made good, and enjoyed. Then; at that happy day of our Lord Chriſt; in the world to come.</p>
                     <p>The looſers, and ſufferers for Chriſts ſake; ſhall, then; be fully rewarded, with all that forementioned; they are encouraged to wait and hope ſtedfaſtly to the end: for great will be the grace that will attend them, at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. In the world to come, it will be ſo. Not ſo fully, in any time in this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106759:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> world. Here, they have the word, and promiſe, ſure, and ſtable, that will not fail. Then, and there: they ſhall have the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. Here, they have the earneſt, (to wit, the ſpirit), then; and, there; they ſhall have in poſſeſſion, and full enjoyment. It is ſaid of the faithful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>All theſe</hi> [to wit, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and thoſe named before] <hi>dyed in faith,</hi> [ſo as they lived] <hi>not having received the promiſes; but having ſeen them afarr off,</hi> [to wit, by the eye of faith] <hi>and they were perſwaded of them</hi> [with high perſwaſion and confidence] <hi>and embraced them</hi> [cheerfully, and joyfully, no queſtion] <hi>and confeſſed, that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth.</hi> Another, a better country, their hearts went out after, and God prepared a better for them: that theſe bleſſed expectants, and all others of like expectation might not fail or miſſe of their hope, <hi>God hath provided for them a city, verſ.</hi> 16. Theſe, they had the promiſe; but they did not receive the things promiſed: <hi>vers.</hi> 13. It is ſaid, <hi>they ſaw them a far off.</hi> As our Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Iohn.</hi> 8. 56. <hi>He rejoyced to ſee Chriſts day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> As they before mentioned were much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſatisfyed concerning the thing, and confeſſed <hi>That they were pilgrims, and ſtrangers in the earth: Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> &amp;c. It is ſpoken of them: good ſervants of God: their thoughts were of another, a better countrey, of a more heavenly nature or kinde, and God hath provided one for them. A citty, a country, new and undefiled. A <hi>new Ieruſalem;</hi> In that happy day of the coming of the Lord Chriſt, in the new earth, in the world to come. The expectants of that happy day may ſay with holy <hi>Peter, bleſſed be God, and the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again into a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> Unto what are we ſo begotten to the lively hope of? he tells us in the words following: <hi>it is to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:</hi> it is ſafe and in ſure hands: it is reſerved in heaven, for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: they are <hi>kept by the power of God through faith, for that great ſalvation, ready to be revealed:</hi> and it is kept for them; and ſhall be brought unto them, they ſhall not need to go to fetch it: but when will it be? at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. 4. 5. He wills the ſervants of God, to hope on, <hi>for that great grace that ſhall be brought unto them at the revelation of Ieſus Chriſt, vers.</hi> 13.</p>
                     <p>Then will <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> be chief among the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106759:48"/> holy ones, as it is ſaid, <hi>many ſhall come from the eaſt, and from the weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaack, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, Math.</hi> 8. 11. This ſeemeth to eye that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. <hi>The feaſt the Lord will make unto all people, in his holy mountain: a feaſt of fat things: and wine well refined, full of marrow and fat things:</hi> ſee the place, it eyeth, in a likely way, as to its full fulfilling, ſuch a time, when <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the holy prophets, and Apoſtles, &amp;c. <hi>ſhall feaſt together, in the kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> It look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beyond the ſpiritual feaſt of the goſpel; to a time, as <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>When death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> Which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54. Relateth to a very far time, for the making of it good, and fulfilling of it: even, the time of the kingdom of the Lord Chriſt, in the world to come. <hi>When corruption ſhall have put on incorruption, and mortality immortalitie.</hi> And as it followeth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with and ſpeaking out that to be the time: all tears will the Lord wipe away from the faces of his people, and the rebuke of his people ſhall be taken away from off all the earth. This world will not as to the full fulfilling of it afford ſuch a happy day: the waited for ſalvation of the people of God ſhall then be fully enjoyed, and great ſhall be their joy and rejoycing.</p>
                     <p>Redemption from the captivity of ſin and ſatan: from death and the grave; ſore enemies and cruel tyrants: believers have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them all in the bloud of Chriſt; and may reckon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves virtually ranſomed and delivered by their redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that they are redemed ones by the price of his moſt precious bloud: but this is only virtually and in the firſt fruits, in the ſure promiſe, in the earneſt, to wit, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the redeemer ſhall fully come to <hi>Sion;</hi> then ſhall the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and deliverance take place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>the deliverer ſhall come to Sion, and ſhall turn away ungodlyneſſe from Iacob:</hi> or as holy <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>the redeemer ſhall come to Sion, and unto them that turn from tranſgreſſion in Jacob.</hi> It is good and true in both readings: thoſe believers, that have turned to God by faith, and repentance: he ſhall come to them; and coming he ſhall take their iniquities quite away. I conceive, by chainging them, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye: putting off their corruption, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on incorruption: ſo he ſhall come to the turned, and likewiſe turn away their iniquitie.</p>
                     <p>The redemption of the body ſhall be then from the priſon and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106759:48"/> power of the grave, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. A great thing! which believers have in the promiſe, and in the earneſt, to wit, the ſpirit: they ſhall have then in the enjoyment of it, the whole man, Body and ſpirit, with all the parts and faculties of both united in one: full and perfect, and it will be eternal redemption, which the redeemer, the Lord Chriſt, hath obtained for his, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. No more ſlavery then to ſin or death or the grave; Chriſt our bleſſed redeemer hath fully ſubdued it, then, and will ſet us fully free; ſo as inſtead of ſaying, as ſometime holy <hi>Paul</hi> did: <hi>who ſhall deliver us from this ſinful body of death?</hi> to wit, ſubject to ſin death and the grave, thoſe great tyrants: we, by faith may ſay according to our preſent intereſt and hope, what ſhall then be ſayd, and ſung aloud in the full poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and enjoyment of it by way of praiſe to their redeemer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Thou art worthy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemeed us by thy bloud; out of every kinred, and tongue, and people and nation; and haſt made us unto our God, kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth:</hi> then followeth that great thanksgiving, of that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the three following verſes, in praiſe of the redeemer.</p>
                     <p>The time this relateth unto, when it will be made good and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, it is very likely it will be then, when our Lord cometh the ſecond time; when the raiſed from the dead, and the then living, changed, ſhall take place: when they ſhall meet the Lord Chriſt, and come with him to the new earth: where he will fully ſet up his kingdom and throne: then will that be fully made good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 11. <hi>The ranſomed of the Lord,</hi> or the redeemed, <hi>ſhall come to Sion with joy, and ſongs, and everlaſting joy ſhall be on their heads, they ſhall obtain gladneſs and joy, and ſorrow and mourning ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> Their rejoycing and felicitie then ſhall not be of the length of a kings reign, as to inſtance in <hi>Solomon;</hi> in whoſe dayes there was great felicity: but it laſted not beyond his dayes: but this, ſhall be everlaſting, <hi>as long as the ſun and moon endureth, Pſal.</hi> 72. 7. This world affords it not, nor never will, it is likely, as to the fulneſs of it. Trouble and ſorrow and diſquiet, hath been and is at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the portion and lot of the righteous, here, in this world, our Lord hath told us ſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Ye,</hi> [to wit, the righteous] <hi>ſhall weep and lament</hi> [that is their condition, here, for a ſeaſon: what ſhall the men of the world do?] <hi>but the world ſhall rejoyce,</hi> [it is their day] <hi>ye,</hi> [namely, the righteous] <hi>ſhall be ſorrowful:</hi> [oh, but when that time comes, they ſhall then rejoyce] <hi>your ſorrow ſhall be</hi>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106759:49"/> 
                        <hi>turned into joy: and their joy, ſhall none take from them.</hi> As to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it, it's the time, when ſorrow, and tears, and pain, and death, ſhall be no more: we know what time that is; it is <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day, in the new earth, in the world to come: then it will be ſo, and all made good and fulfilled in the fulneſs and length of time.</p>
                     <p>Of neere affinity with redemption, is ſalvation or being ſaved, which we ſhall dilate on a little. Not after the way of a theam, or common place: but only, as ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, the bleſſed ſaviour of ſuch as believe in him. The beginning of it, and firſt fruits, here, in regeneration, in this world: and the full harveſt and perfection in the world to come, at that happy day of our Lord Chriſt, when, as it is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 28. <hi>To them that look for him, he ſhall appear the ſecond time with ut ſin unto ſalvation:</hi> full ſalvation of ſoul and body, ſalvation to the utmoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the ſpirit of regeneration; it hath for the earneſt of the whole; the holy ſpirit: and it hath ſure promiſes; all <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt. About which; faith in the ſervants of God, is exerciſed, laying hold on them; and with much conſolation and encouragement go on from faith to faith, after the way of the living of the juſt: they live by faith, and they alſo dye in faith, and do not receive the thing promiſed, to wit, full ſalvation. They that went before, to wit, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. Nor thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after, ſince their day; they have not; neither ſhall they, or any others, receive it, till that bleſſed time come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Theſe all dyed in faith, and received not the promiſe:</hi> ſo, <hi>vers.</hi> 39. <hi>They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a good report through faith, but received not the promiſe.</hi> It is the ſalvation of the whole man, body and ſpirit united in one, as at the firſt, when <hi>God made man, and breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a living ſoul,</hi> or perſon: of that we ſpeak: which the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>is nearer then when we firſt believed.</hi> It grows nearer and nearer. As we have a mighty redeemer, ſo we have a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſaviour, <hi>who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt. Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He hath undertaken it, he hath begun it, he will perfect it, and finiſh it to the full, then, at that time, will that be made good to the full, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Now is come ſalvation:</hi> now ſo as never before, full, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, perfect: it was before but in the beginning, and in the way to perfecting, but then it will be fully finiſhed in the world to come, and true to the utmoſt; when our Lord cometh again, and all his faints and ſaved ones with him. Then, the miſtery of godlyneſs and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106759:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſalvation will be finiſhed; <hi>as he hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, Rev.</hi> 10. 7. This great ſalvation, the prophets, as holy <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. have enquired, and ſearched diligently, who prophecyed of that great grace: (the ſaviour that brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto all the ſaved ones) they enquired after the manner, and after the time, teſtifyed by the ſpirit, when it began or was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in a way of humiliation, and ſuffering of the Lord Chriſt: and end: and be perfected, in great enſuing glory, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. O happy, and bleſſed ſaying, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life</hi> [and our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation] <hi>ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory;</hi> and behold him in his glory, and be like unto him.</p>
                     <p>The happy reſtoration of all things that God hath ſpoken, muſt here be treated of; but I ſhall wave it here, and ſpeak of it after by it ſelf; and ſhall take knowledge of ſomething concerning immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie and eternal life; which <hi>Adam</hi> was not poſſeſſed of: a great thing indeed; of which the holy ſcriptures of the new teſtament ſpeak much: a bleſſed thing to come which will be enjoyed, then; at that happy day of the Lord Chriſt, in the world to come; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, and eternal life are of neere affinity, as the cauſe and the effect; the root and the fruit: immortality, hath for its contrary, mortalitie or dying which all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> know experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally: we have treated of it before, and ſhall be breif in what ſhall be further offered. The ſame may be ſaid of immortality and life everlaſting, as was ſayd of redemption and ſalvation; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, have the promiſe and likewiſe the earneſt, to wit, the ſpirit in their hearts, here in this world, but not the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, otherwiſe then as afore, the things themſelves in the real poſſeſſing and enjoying of them to the full, in the world to come, as it is written, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 30. The ſufferers for Chriſt, ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards here. In this world, and in the world to come everlaſting life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 30. the ſame. Immortalitie is ſo great a thing, as the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us, <hi>God only hath Immortality.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16 He will give it, at that day, by Jeſus Chriſt, to the raiſed, and to the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ones: they ſhall then and not before, (whatever ſome unwiſely ſay) put on immortalitie, as it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. 54. <hi>This morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, it ſhall put on immortalitie.</hi> Then it ſhall be, as is elſewhere ſaid, <hi>mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. to wit, of life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, the concomitant of immortalitie.</p>
                     <p>This of immortalitie, and life everlaſting appertains unto, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106759:50"/> ſhall be enjoyed by the whole perſon, the body more eſpecially: into which, the ſpirit or angelical part was breathed by almighty God, when he firſt made man? this is vulgarly called the ſoul: happily not very properly: it is a received principle that dyes not nor is capable of it, but returns to God that gave it, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. how, and where, and in what manner it ſubſiſteth, and whether it hath ſympathy, and diſtinct deſire, as it had in the body? is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, a very high, and very hidden thing: of which I ſhall forbear to ſay any thing.</p>
                     <p>To be made immortal and put into ſuch an eſtate, is a condition, beyond what <hi>Adam</hi> attained unto in his happy eſtate: it is one of the additions of bleſſedneſs, the raiſed and changed ſaints ſhall be made partakers of, at that happy day very few have as yet, and it is likely none ſhall further attain it till then; and then they ſhall put it on and enjoy it; thoſe <hi>that by patient continuing in well doing, ſeek for glory, honor, and immortalitie, and eternal life, Rom.</hi> 2. 7. They ſhall then finde it, according to the promiſe of the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Seek, and ye ſhall finde,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch ſhall finde and enjoy immortalitie and everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>This life, (to wit, eternal life) of the ſaints of God, <hi>it is hid with Chriſt, in God: and when he that is their life,</hi> ſo, <hi>ſhall appear; then ſhall they alſo appear with him in that ſtate of glory and immortality and life eternal.</hi> As it is written, <hi>the gift of God is eternal life.</hi> It ſhall be given them then, as our Lord ſayth, concerning his ſheep that hear his voice, <hi>he gives them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, or be loſt, Rom.</hi> 6. 22. 23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 27. 28. they ſhall be immortal, then, though now for the preſent they be mortal and dying dayly.</p>
                     <p>The Angelical part or ſpirit in man, ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, and barely minded ſo, ſeemeth not to be reckoned as eternal life in the ſcriptures; without the further gift of God, and grace of the ſaviour; together with all thoſe adjuncts of bleſſedneſs, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, adjoyned as attendants, making up the whole: for that the wicked, as they have ſuch angelical ſpirits in their day, here, ſo they in their day, hereafter, will have a kinde of immortalitie, and eternity in the world to come. The holy ſcriptures imply, of the everlaſting life of the wicked, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 41. <hi>Then ſhall the king ſay, Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 46. <hi>And theſe ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment:</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 9. <hi>Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi>

                        <hi>and glory of his power; their worm never dyeth, and their fire it never goeth out:</hi> implying, their continual being and exiſtence, in order to wo and a ſad condition: then; it may be ſaid of them, as ſometime our Lord ſaid of <hi>Judas; good had it been for that man, if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born:</hi> ſo, good were it for the wicked, if there were no reſurrection, nor life after this: but that they remained for ever in the grave, in oblivion, and were anihilated and extinct for ever. But alaſs it is otherwiſe! they muſt live again, and that in woe, and torment, for ever!</p>
                     <p>But the eternal life of the juſt, their life everlaſting will be a bleſſed and a happy life, accompanied with all the bleſſed attendants and enjoyments of happyneſs and bleſſedneſs, and freedom from all woe and miſery for ever: this happy enjoyment of life eternal, or everlaſting, often ſpoken of by our Lord, and the Apoſtles, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the new teſtament, it is only enjoyable here, in the firſt fruits, and in the way of the beginning of it: believers have thoſe bleſſed fruits of the ſpirit, faith and hope: faith aſſures them and helps them to reckon thoſe things that are not as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. And hope it fixeth a ſoul in the full expectation there of it; for that hope is of things not ſeen or enjoyed; for ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>how can a man hope for that he ſeeth? Rom.</hi> 8. 24. written to <hi>Titus. chap.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 7. he ſpeaks of the hope of eternal life: and he ſayth alſo, <hi>it is the hope of eternal life, which God hath promiſed before the world began,</hi> Holy <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 25. ſaith, <hi>This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life:</hi> We have it in the beginning, we have it in the earneſt, the ſpirit. We have it in faith and hope, thoſe bleſſed fruits of the ſpirit of God. We have it in the ſure word and promiſe, which is <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen:</hi> we have it as the ſervants of God have redemption and ſalvation: ſo we have immortalitie and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: and it ſhall be brought and given unto us, at the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt; then they ſhall be endowed with it: they ſhall then put on immortalitie and inherit everlaſting life.

Whither the forerunner [to wit, the Lord Jeſus] is for us entred and gone before, in order to our enjoying of all thoſe great good things, before mentioned; together with everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>One of thoſe great things that ſhall take place and be made good, at the coming of the Lord Chriſt, is that miſtery ſhewed by holy

                        <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. That <hi>the believers that ſhall be found alive at the coming of the Lord Chriſt, ſhall not die but be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye:</hi> of the which, we have treated before: a very great thing, concurring, in time with thoſe other great things before held forth: I ſhall therefore forbear to treat of it here. I ſhall only offer this as very likely: that the holy Apoſtle had it by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or otherwiſe he learned it of our Lord Chriſt, who in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with <hi>Martha,</hi> at <hi>Lazarus</hi> his death, held forth the very ſame thing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 20. Our Lord cometh where <hi>Lazarus</hi> was then dead: ſhe, to wit, <hi>Martha,</hi> goeth to meet him, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. ſhe ſayth, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not dyed.</hi> Vers. 22. her faith being ſtrong, ſhe ſayth to our Lord, <hi>I know, that whatever thou wilt ask of God, he will give it thee. Vers.</hi> 23. Our Lord ſayth to her, <hi>thy brother ſhall riſe again! vers.</hi> 24.

And our Lord tells her further; that, <hi>he that believeth in him, though he were dead,</hi> [as <hi>Lazarus</hi> then was] <hi>yet he ſbould live.</hi> As <hi>Lazarus,</hi> preſently after did: then; <hi>vers.</hi> 26. He tells her, <hi>that whoſoever liveth, and believeth in him, ſhall never dye:</hi> he asked her <hi>whether ſhe believed that?</hi> alaſs! ſhe, its likely, was at a loſſe in the underſtanding of it, (as are many of the ſervants of God now) and therefore ſhe anſwereth not: our Lord Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not believers of that time, ſuch as <hi>Martha,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that were there preſent; nor any others, believing in him, of that time: but only ſuch as believing ſhould be alive at his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: as holy <hi>Paul,</hi> hath fully informed us; as for <hi>Martha,</hi> and all the Apoſtles, and believers in Jeſus, in that age, and in the ages ſince: they have all dyed, and ſo they will die, till that day take place; and then ſhall that be fulfilled and made good, ſayd then by our Lord Chriſt: <hi>that he that liveth, and believeth in him ſhall never dye:</hi> for ſuch, ſhall only be changed: in a moment in the twinkling of an eye; as <hi>Adam</hi> was changed for the worſe, and lived; ſo ſhall they be changed for the better, and continue living ſtill; putting on immortalitie, and eternal life.</p>

The firſt creation, and making of all things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. may be minded; as the Image and figure, according to which the reſtitution or reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will be a returning again into the ſame mode and figure, ſtate and condition they were in at their firſt making and framing by God himſelf: liked and teſtified <hi>to be very good:</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> by ſin and tranſgreſſion greatly marred and disfigured; ſin and the curſe following; and all manner of woe and miſery following, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect followeth its cauſe.</p>
                     <p>What holy <hi>Moſes</hi> hath writ concerning the creation of man, and of the earth, and of the creatures therein, together with the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the waters. What is ſaid and teſtified by the Lord almighty the maker of them all; concerning the goodneſs of them, and his liking of them; the teſtimony given is very high, <hi>vers.</hi> 31. <hi>and God ſaw all that he had made, and behold, it was very good.</hi> The weighing and conſideratien whereof; will be a good coppy to write by; a good pattern or ſample, for us to ſet before us in order to our better taking knowledge of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. We have a deſcription of the making the world day by day; and the making of man as the moſt principal piece of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creation: <hi>vers.</hi> 26. <hi>and God ſaid, let us make man in our own Image, vers.</hi> 27. <hi>ſo God created man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him, male and female created he them.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 26. <hi>God bleſſed them,</hi> [ſo made, in that marvelous condition] <hi>and ſaid, be fruitfull and multiplie, and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it;</hi> having the grant of power given before, <hi>vers.</hi> 26. a very large grant a great charter of power, given of God to man, in his innocent ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall, and tranſgreſſion; and the loſſe he and his poſteritie,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106759:52"/> and the whole earthly creation received thereby: upon the whole, it is ſaid, <hi>vers.</hi> 31. <hi>and God ſaw every thing that he had made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it was very good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reſtoration it will be proportionable, and alſo very good. <hi>Adam</hi> ſo made was a very choice piece: in the Image of God, and in the likenes of God: of great rectitude marvellous complete and happy: by his tranſgreſſion and diſobedience, he ſuffered great loſſe and damage; as did his poſterity, and the whole earthly creatures, and great enmitie attended them; and much thraldom and miſerie.</p>
                     <p>But at the happy time of our Lord Chriſt being ſent from heaven again, then there will be a bleſſed reſtitution and reſtoration of all things. Then ſhall many be rechanged, in a moment for the better; as he was before for the worſe: then ſhall that miſtery holy <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſhewed, take place. Then this vile body, ſinfull and corrupt, ſhall be rechanged, <hi>and made like his glorious body;</hi> according to that full and clear teſtimony of holy <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 20. 21. <hi>from heaven we look for the ſaviour, the Lord Jeſus, who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body:</hi> pure, ſerene, and glorious, without ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing: as he will make his Church then alſo: and this by changing, in a moment, by putting off and putting on putting off corruption and ſin; and putting on purity, incorruption and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it is written, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. 54. holy <hi>Paul,</hi> tells us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. of the Lord Chriſt himſelf, [in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he] <hi>ſhall deſcend from heaven:</hi> he did aſcend as an Angel, <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. 11. told the beholders, and lookers after him, when he ſo aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſaid, <hi>this Jeſus, which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner, as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> Even the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, as teſtifieth the Apoſtle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 9. he ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain deſcend, when God ſhall ſend him again; at the time of the reſtitution of all things; and then ſhall thoſe believers found alive, be changed in a moment into their former happy ſtate, with ſome happy additions of bleſſednes.</p>
                     <p>The old man, ſo called, which the ſervants of God are bidden to put off, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. Which in this day of regeneration believers have been ſubduing, and crucifying, by the exerciſe of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſanctification of the ſpirit, and yet carry it to the grave with them; they ſhall then be wholy rid of it: in a moment, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an eye, and ſhall then put on the new man indeed, and be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106759:53"/> clothed very glorious, by being ſo changed; all new then, relating to the ſervants of God; as he from the throne, ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I make all things new: a new heaven, a new earth, a new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, come down from heaven, a new covenant,</hi> new bodyes, new hearts and ſpirits, new creatures; all things new.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adams</hi> upright, and perfect condition as a man; and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the earth, and the creatures therein, liked by God himſelf when he viewed them, after he had made them: is it is likely the ſtandard and pattern according to which the reſtoration will be; as it was at firſt before mans fall; and the entring the curſe, ſo it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like to be in the reſtoration.</p>
                     <p>In regard of man as man, the change in a moment will effect it. In that happy time, when man will not only be, as at his firſt creating: but enjoy ſome bleſſed additions to his happy eſtate: namely, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility therein, immortalitie, and life everlaſting: the high enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſence of God, and the Lord Chriſt, high intereſt in the new covenant, and more of the ſpirit and grace of the ſaviour, then <hi>Adam</hi> ever had, and that for evermore.</p>
                     <p>But there is ſomething further conſiderable: <hi>man was made, male and female; in the image of God they were created</hi> ſo. And was made with ſeed in him, whereby to propagate poſteritie: he had a wiſe given him of God; for that, it was not good for him to be alone. A woman, or female, ſuitable unto him, was formed out of him, in a wonderful wiſe; and they were bidden <hi>to multiply and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it.</hi> and God made nothing in vain. He had, no queſtion, in his innocent eſtate, if he had continued in it, and not fell from it, generated and repleniſhed the earth; as he did after, in his fallen condition; being bidden to do ſo before: in order to what will be at the reſtoration and change, in that moment, at our Lord his coming; the ſcripture ſeemeth ſilent in it, and ſo I ſhall be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe till time diſcover further; or that day it ſelf declare. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate to prevent prejudice; that I do not in the leaſt intend the including of the raiſed ones, or children of the reſurrection, in the caſe before ſpoken of; their condition ſeeming much to differ from that of the changed alive, then; it is ſaid by our Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 30. That <hi>in the reſurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the Angels of God in heaven:</hi> but the changed alive; will be men and women (as <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were in their firſt eſtate) ſuch, by whom that happy world to come will be begun and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106759:53"/> as that firſt world would have been, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fell. The old world was ſo after <hi>Adams</hi> fall; and how the new world to come will be? ſome way or how it will be it is likely, I ſhall ſay no more. Further it is intimated, that the ſeperate condition of man is not in the leaſt medled with; but man intire; as he will be at his being changed; at the reſtoration of all things.</p>
                     <p>Having made this digreſſion; I premiſe one or two things more, namely, that the reſtoration and changing in a moment, it will be here below on earth: it will be from this old corrupt earth under the curſe, to that new: which God will create; wherein will dwell bleſſing: which we according to the promiſe look for, at that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day.</p>
                     <p>And that by the world to come, ſpoken of in the holy ſcriptures, in which this reſtoration will take place, is not meant of heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, but a ſtate here below on earth: and that to take it for heaven properly, or underſtand it ſo, is to offer loſſe to the holy ſcriptures; and that which in effect renders inſignificant, and makes void what is ſaid in them, concerning the reſtoration of all things; the change, in a moment; the new earth; with all things made new, by him ſitting on the throne; with very many other things that might be mentioned.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, I premiſe, that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> will be the people highly concerned, and cheif in this reſtoration, and change: the <hi>twelve thouſand of every tribe of Iſrael:</hi> and that their land, the land of promiſe, will ſhare, in a principal wiſe, in that happy reſtoration and change; and in a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way; be the center of the new earth. We ſhall now return to the matter we had under conſideration before; namely, man conſidered according to propagation and off-ſpring. How acceptable to ſome, the propoſing of it will be, I know not: but it will be ſome way neceſſary, in order to the better minding and taking knowledge of ſundrie high prophecies that ſeem to look that way, and to relate to that day. Firſt, that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 20. 21. the coming of the redeemer to <hi>Sion;</hi> of which we treated before, it relateth, as to the full fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, to that happy day, of the changing in a moment, and the bleſſed reſtoration of all things then.

That very high prophecy, in order to the reſtoration of all things: ſpeaking in the former part, of the Lord Chriſt, and the happineſs then: <hi>vers.</hi> 6.

And that which followeth, ſpeaks forth a wonderful change in the creature; and that their hurtfulnes, and devouring nature, will then be taken away, by the reſtoration; and they made harmleſſe, as at their firſt making; ſo as that will then be that followeth, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy,</hi> [not theſe in the new earth] <hi>in all my holy mountain.</hi> But as to that of ſeed, and offspring, then: here is a little child and a ſucking child; here is a weaned childe, very likely to be ſuch then; at that happy time of the reſtoration, and change: when the groaning creatures, under their preſent bondage, ſhall be freed, and be delivered into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. which as they are capable they ſhall enjoy and be made partakers of. That of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is very conſiderable, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25. Speaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their dwelling in their own land: the land of promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> he ſayth thus, <hi>And ye ſhall dwell in the land, I have given to Jacob my ſervant, wherein your fathers have dwelt, and they ſhall dwell therein, even they and their children, and their childrens children, for ever.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106759:55"/> ſtone, which ſome are ſtrong in their thoughts for, as having much of ſcripture for it, as they judge, which I ſhall not meddle with here: it is reckoned ſhort: but for forty or five and forty years: will that amount to make good to the full, what he hath ſaid? <hi>they ſhall dwell in it, and their children, and their childrens children for ever.</hi> And hath <hi>David,</hi> Gods ſervant (to wit, Chriſt) been, or is he in his perſon, like to be a prince or ruler in this old world for ever? is it not more like to be in the world to come, in the day of the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? let the wiſe in heart conſider.</p>
                     <p>Having held forth ſomething concerning the reſtoration and change of man, and the creatures, according to what is held forth in the holy ſcriptures, and the prophecyes therein conteyned: it may be neceſſary to take a little notice, and ſee what is ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the place where they will have their aboad and being then, at the reſtoration: The prophet <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 65. 17. He tells us of a <hi>new earth: for behold I create a new heaven, and a new earth;</hi> for which the ſervants of God in the verſe following, are bidden <hi>to be glad and rejoyce.</hi> Holy <hi>Peter,</hi> likewiſe tells us, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. That we according to his promiſe, <hi>look for a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein ſhall dwell righteouſnes;</hi> to wit, righteous men, and things. Holy <hi>John</hi> he tells us, <hi>Rev</hi> 21. 1. <hi>Of a new heaven, and a new earth, which he ſaw.</hi> This newnes it will be by a reſtoration and change. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 27. ſpeaking of the old; he ſayth, <hi>they ſhall periſh and wax old as a garment, as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed:</hi> and, as before made new; for the ſervants of God, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to inhabit and dwell in for they ſhall be changed and continue, and dwell there: ſee <hi>vers.</hi> 28. It ſeemeth to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and ſpeaks out much; <hi>the children of thy ſervants ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before thee.</hi> Even in the new earth; for till then they ſhall continue to make good the prophecy: then ſhall that be made good in the new earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 21. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be all righteous, they ſhall inherit the land for ever.</hi> This plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it will be of God himſelf, for his own glory: the changed in a moment, will be ſuch righteous ones: a bleſſed plantation indeed, where no polluter or polluted, ſhall enter or be found, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it, any thing that defileth: the meek, they ſhall inherit the earth. Math.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
                     <p>The reſtoration will effect great things for the better, as <hi>Adam</hi> his ſin and tranſgreſſion, did for the worſe; which will be removed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106759:55"/> and done away: it was ſaid by the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. 18. 19. <hi>Curſed is the earth</hi> (or ground) <hi>for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat thereof all the dayes of thy life: thorns, and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth; in the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread till thou return to the ground,</hi> &amp;c. A very ſore curſe and puniſhment; a change greatly for the worſe; it not being ſo before: as it will not be then; when the reſtoration takes place, and the change for the better, ſo greatly: all things made new and reſtored as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>The curſe taken off, no curſe there then, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3. as now; none of the bitter fruits of tranſgreſſion and the curſe, that attended man and the creatures: as ſorrow and pain, ſickneſs and want, hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and toyl for bread: barrenneſs of the earth, and thorns, and thiſtles, and want of all good things: all removed and taken away with the curſe, at this happy reſtoration of all things: wherein the land of promiſe, <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed, to Jacob, and his</hi> called <hi>Iſraelites, Gen.</hi> 35. 12. <hi>The land I gave Abraham, and Iſaack, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed after thee, will I give the land.</hi> This land is like to fare well, and to be the chief: the center of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py change, and reſtoration of the earth, and making of it new. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 8. <hi>He hath remembred his covenant for ever, the word he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to a thouſand generations.</hi> Not yet compleated, it is likely: but that it will extend to that time of the reſtoration. <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. 10. Which he confirmed by covenant and oath: <hi>vers.</hi> 11. The thing is declared, <hi>to thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> &amp;c. If God will remember his covenant for ever, to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand generations; it will fare well with that land then; as likewiſe with the lands and dwellings of the ſaved nations, that ſhall walk in <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> light, and ſhare with them in all their bleſſedneſs, and glory, then: that ſpeaks out much, and is very high, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>And I will remove the iniquitie of that land in one day,</hi> to wit, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day of the reſtoration: <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>In thoſe dayes, and in that time, ſayth the Lord, the iniquitie of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of Iudah, and they ſhall not be found,</hi> &amp;c. Then; will there be no more curſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3. For that will be gone and be no more found there. Then will that be made good and fully ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>And all nations ſhall call you bleſſed, for ye ſhall be a delightfull land; ſayeth the Lord of hoſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was propheſyed of old, by <hi>Noah; that God ſhould enlarge Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and he ſhould dwell in the Tents of ſhem:</hi> likely to be made good

                     <p>As for the intereſt of the creature, and their ſharing, according to their capabilitie, in the bleſſedneſs of that happy day; ſee what is ſaid, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19.

                     <head>CHAP XI. <hi>Containing the propoſal of ſome other prophecyes, that ſpeak of a bleſſed and flouriſhing condition, and great proſperitie, peace, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great bleſſings, the righteous ſhall then enjoy, when our Lord Chriſt comes, and the bleſſed reſtoration takes place, and the freedom from all want woe and miſery then.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THere are other propheſies beſides thoſe that ſpeak of ſeed, off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, children and poſteritie; that ſpeak of great proſperitie the righteous ſhall enjoy then, at the reſtoration and coming of the Lord: namely of the enjoyment of inheritance and poſeſſions, vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and olive yards; of planting, and ſowing, and reaping the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106759:56"/> fruit, of eating and drinking, building houſes and dwelling in them, of ſitting under their own vines, and figtrees, and none making them afraid, of flouriſhing, and enjoying abundance of all good things; all which, are looked on as low carnal things, by ſome, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the happineſs of the bleſſed ſtate and condition of the righteous in the world to come: which they count and would have to be heaven it ſelf: and therefore thoſe aforeſaid things are paſſed over and little notice taken of them: or they are referred to times, ſhort of that happy day for their being made good: or otherwiſe, they are allegorized, and have ſome ſpiritual meaning put upon them: but however notwithſtanding, it is very likely, that all thoſe things in the fulneſs according as they are expreſſed in the holy writ, as foretold by the prophets, ſhall be made good and take place: and there hath no ſuch time been yet: it is probable nor ſhort of that happy time of the reſtoration and change, is there like to be, the full performance and making good the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I do conceive that I cannot without the attracting conſure, and ſuffering loſſe, and being cryed out on as being erronious at the leaſt, propoſe theſe things to conſideration; the ſpirits of ſome are ſo keen, and their thoughts ſo high ſet the other way, that they will cry <hi>carnal, carnal,</hi> at the leaſt, if not far worſe; however I ſhall bear it, and go on. And ſhall premiſe, as a copy to write by, and as a ſtandard to meaſure by, the condition and ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> and the earth, as it was at the firſt, when God created it, before mans fall, and the curſe that entered thereupon: the reſtoration and change will be into the ſame eſtate and condition, with ſome bleſſed advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the enjoyers of it, at that happy day. Upon the ſerious-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof ſomething haply may appear, not thought of: for as God neither made, nor ordained any thing in vain, ſo he hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, or promiſed nothing that is inſignificant, uſeleſs, and unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſtate and condition of man: <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were man and woman: the changed alive in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, will be the like.</p>
                     <p>We propoſe in the firſt place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. It is ſpoken of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the type, but of the Lord Chriſt the great <hi>Solomon</hi> in the antitype. Weigh the <hi>Pſalm</hi> in the whole, as ſpeaking of the happy day of Chriſts kingdom: to be brief, conſider <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>In his days</hi> [to wit, the Lord Chriſt] <hi>the righteous ſhall flouriſh, and abundance of peace</hi> [with the enjoying of all good things] <hi>as long as the moon endureth.</hi>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:106759:57"/> See alſo, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>A handfull of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains, the fruit thereof ſhall ſhake like</hi> Lebanon, <hi>and they of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall flouriſh like the graſſe of the earth.</hi> There was in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, a very happy time; and an high attainer; the higheſt that ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> attayned unto at any time, or that for a time they are like to attain unto in this world; of peace, plenty and proſperity; but alaſe! it laſted not, but went off with him. And beſides, it is ſhort of what is ſpoken of in the Pſalm: and in laſtingneſs no compariſon: <hi>for that ſhall abide, as long as the moon endureth.</hi> When the Lord Chriſt reigneth, there ſhall be great honour and ſubjection given to him by the great ones; and it will fare well with the poor, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. 13. 14. alſo <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 4, 6. of this 72. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> then ſhall that be fulfilled and made good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. 3. 4. 6. 7. <hi>Let the people praiſe thee, O God, let all the people praiſe thee; O let the nations be glad and ſing for joy: for thou ſhalt judge the people righteouſly, and govern the nations upon earth. Let the people praiſe thee;</hi> As they will do then: they will ſing Hallelujans and prayſe to the lamb: what followeth then? <hi>then ſhall the earth yeeld her encreaſe</hi> [very fruitful times then] <hi>and God, even our own God ſhall bleſſe us, and all the ends of the earth ſhall fear him.</hi> It will be ſo eminently then.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, take we knowledge of that very eminent place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. It is the prophecy where the new heaven, and the new earth are ſpoken of and promiſed; ſee what is ſaid, in <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>Therefore, thus ſayeth the Lord, behold, my ſervants ſhall eat but ye ſhall be hungry</hi> [to wit, the wicked and unſaved nations and people] <hi>behold, my ſervants ſhall drink, but ye ſhall be thirſty: behold,</hi> [all with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: very obſervable] <hi>my ſervants ſhall rejoyce but ye ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; vers.</hi> 14. <hi>Behold my ſervants ſhall ſing for joy of heart, but ye ſhall cry for ſorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of ſpirit, vers.</hi> 15. <hi>And ye ſhall leave your name for a curſe unto my choſen; for the Lord God ſhall ſlay thee, and call his ſervants by another</hi> [a new] <hi>name:</hi> a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then; like that of <hi>Dives,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> we ſee, here is eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking then; for ſo did <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſo did our Lord Chriſt in the day of his being here, both before his death, and after his reſurrection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 42. 43. And ſo very likely will thoſe changed alive, then do: for they will be men, and women. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, as a reaſon; and that with a <hi>behold,</hi> alſo <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I create a new heaven, and a new earth:</hi> The old will be done away, and forgotten <hi>vers.</hi> 18.

See the prophecy at large: I ſpare to ſet it down, for fear or being over-large; And conſider to what time it relateth, for its full fulfilling: <hi>at the time, of the branch of righteouſneſs grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to David;</hi> in the land, it will be.

                     </p>
                     <p>Further, ſee what the prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> ſayth, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe when Ieruſalem ſhall be holy, and no ſtranger paſſe through her any more;</hi> as they ſhall, in no wiſe then; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>at that day,</hi> then at that day, <hi>the mountains ſhall drop down new wiue, and the hills ſhall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah ſhall flow with waters: a fountain ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the valley of Chittim.</hi> [It will go ill with <hi>Egypt</hi> then]: <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>But Judah ſhall dwell for ever, and Jeruſalem, from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation:</hi> for God will then cleanſe; ſo, as never before: I conceive, by changing of them in a moment: <hi>for the Lord dwelleth in Sion: and his tabernacle will then be with men, Rev.</hi> 21. 3. <hi>And he will dwell with men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, ſee what the prophet <hi>Micha</hi> ſayth alſo; in the matter, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes</hi> [not yet made good] <hi>that the mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be exalted and eſtabliſhed,</hi> &amp;c: ſee the place, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>And he</hi> [to wit, the Lord Chriſt, when he cometh eſpecially] <hi>ſhall rebuke ſtrong nations, and judge many people: And they ſhall beat their ſwords into plowſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks, nation ſhall not lift up a ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nation neither learn war any more:</hi> a bleſſed peaceable time then. <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. <hi>But they ſhall ſit every man under his vine, and under his figtree and none ſhall make them afraid:</hi> though they have no defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive arms: for there will be no need of them: ſure enough to be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106759:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> made true and good: <hi>for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Then at that day, will be the peaceable kingdom of the Lord Chriſt: and he as <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>The Lord ſhall reign over them in mount Sion from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, and for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See what the prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſayth alſo, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 9. 10. <hi>And I will remove the iniquity of that land</hi> [to wit, the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,] <hi>in one day;</hi> namely, the day of the reſtoration: and when it ſhall be ſo, then; <hi>they ſhall call every one his neighbor under the vine and under the figtree.</hi> The prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaketh of the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that day, even upon the ſame account <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>And ye ſhall be a delightfull land, ſayth the Lord God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are other high prophecyes in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. from <hi>vers.</hi> 5. to <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and from thence to <hi>vers.</hi> 24. See what great things of like importance, are ſaid, which I ſhall forbear to dilate on. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 11. 12. There are prophecyes in the holy ſcriptures, that ſpeak of inheritances, and poſſeſſions: of Lot and ſharing by Lot, that ſeem as to their full fulfilling to relate to that happy day of the reſtoration, and the new earth promiſed taking place. As ſome time of old the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe given <hi>Iſrael</hi> for an inheritance by the Lord; was after a long time divided to them by Lot; and accordingly poſſeſſed by them in a way of particular propriety: for they had not only a general light in the whole land, as ſo given them of God, but they had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt in a part of it, as it fell unto them by Lot: where the Lord himſelf was the determiner; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayth <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>The Lot is caſt into the lap: but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord:</hi> whither that land ſo promiſed, and after a long time poſſeſſed, and divided by Lot, was not a type of the new earth promiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and of ſome higher diviſion and ſharing at the reſtoration of all things, may be conſidered; and the rather becauſe of what <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> hath declared, which will have its fulfilling and making good; though as yet we underſtand it not: it is very probable it is not yet fulfilled; but will ſure enough; which the day will declare fully, though to us it is dark, and we underſtand little. Every tribe, as well as the whole people, will have their ſhare and Lot: and the ſtrangers will ſhare with them, where his dwelling is with them then; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 22. 23. very conſiderable. The twelve tribes, they are to have every one their ſhare, or Lot: and the prince his: and he muſt not take any of the peoples ſhare from them, to drive them
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106759:59"/> out of their poſſeſſion, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 18. <hi>The twelve tribes will have intereſt in the city, and every one a gate called by their name: and the name of the city from that day</hi> [very probable to be the day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration] <hi>will be, the Lord is there: He will be ſo, in the new earth, Rev.</hi> 21. 3.</p>
                     <p>The prophet <hi>Obadiah</hi> hath ſomething to the ſame effect, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>But in mount Sion there ſhall be deliverance, and there ſhall be holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the houſe of Jacob, ſhall poſſeſſe their poſſeſſions. Vers.</hi> 19. <hi>And they of the ſouth ſhall poſſeſſe the mount of Eſau: and they of the plain the philiſtins; and they ſhall poſſeſſe the feilds of Ephraim, and the feilds of Samaria; and</hi> Benjamin <hi>ſhall poſſeſse</hi> Gilead. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>And the captivitie of the host of Iſrael, ſhall poſſeſſe that of the Canaanites, even unto</hi> Zarephath; <hi>and the captivity of Jeruſalem, which is in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharad, ſhall poſſeſſe the cities of the ſouth. Vers.</hi> 21. <hi>And ſaviours</hi> [or judges and diſpoſers] <hi>ſhall come upon the mount Sion, to judge the mount of Eſau. And</hi> [this it will be when] <hi>the kingdom ſhall be the Lords:</hi> for as yet it hath not been nor is it likely ſo fully to be, till that happy time takes place.</p>
                     <p>The rather is that conſiderable, becauſe of what the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holds forth this way, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>In the fulnes of times, in the Lord Chriſt, he ſhould gather together in one, the things in heaven, and the things in the earth, even in him;</hi> [reſtore them, make them new; all good, and holy, as at firſt.] <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. <hi>In whom we have obtained an inheritance or Lot. Vers.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>The ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> is ſayd to be <hi>the earneſt of our inheritance;</hi> to wit, of our intereſt, and right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and that we ſhall in time poſſeſſe it: we have for the preſent the earneſt, we ſhall have in the appointed time the full purchaſe: it will be redeemed and ſettled on thoſe it is redeemed and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for; to the praiſe of the glory of him that hath done it for his. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 5. It is ſpoken of by the Apoſtle as a known thing; <hi>that no wicked, unclean perſon, hath any inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, or of God;</hi> to wit, <hi>in that kingdom to</hi> come. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, of giving thanks unto the father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light. The ſaints will then have inheritance given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, at that time when <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> light is come, and the glory of the Lord riſeth upon her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 1. when ſhe will ſine gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; holy <hi>Peter,</hi> in like manner, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. bleſſeth God, for <hi>the lively hope, the ſervants of God are begotten again unto, by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>

                        <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance,</hi> [the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſuiteth with the reſtoration, and change: it is] <hi>incorruptible and undefiled:</hi> it will be ſo when it falls in with that time; when the iniquity of that land is removed, and the curſe taken from the earth, and it made new; in the inheritance then and there: then will be no corruption, or defilement: for <hi>there ſhall in no wiſe enter any that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth, Rev.</hi> 21. 27. it is ſaid further, that it fadeth not away; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in this world mens inheritances do; but it will not be ſo then: it is in ſure hands, in ſafe keeping; it is laid up in heaven for you, to wit, for the ſervants of God. It may be asked by ſome, how we ſhall come to have it? how we ſhall get to heaven to receive it? take no care; there is no need of abſconding: for <hi>vers.</hi> 13. holy <hi>Peter</hi> tells us <hi>it ſhall be brought unto us.</hi> And telleth, when alſo: <hi>at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when the Lord Chriſt ſhall be revealed from heaven, and the dead raiſed; and the living ſaints then changed, it will be brought unto the ſervants of God from heaven. We have now the earneſt of it, as before: and we have the promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. then the called ſhall receive that eternal inheritance, according to the promiſe: which faith, and hope, are now exerciſed about, for the good of the ſervants of God: but ſhall then give place, when the thing it ſelf is poſſeſſed, and enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>The new teſtament ſeemeth to ſpeak ſparingly, concerning good things, in a particular way. Our Lord tells his, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. of manſion places (or houſes) he is gone to prepare for his: that he would come again, and receive them to himſelf: and that where he is, there they ſhould be alſo. We are told, that <hi>in his preſence, is fullneſs of joy, and pleaſures for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 10. 10. holy <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. that <hi>the eye hath not ſeen, nor the ear heard, nor hath it entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man to conceive, what</hi> [good things] <hi>God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them that love him.</hi> Holy <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>now we are the ſons of God but it doth not yet appear,</hi> [or is not manifeſt] <hi>what we ſhall be:</hi> how fully happy and bleſſed in our enjoyments: only <hi>we ſhall be for ever with the Lord;</hi> that may ſatisfy us.</p>
                     <p>The Scriptures of the new teſtament, they tell us rather of what we ſhall be freed from: what we ſhall not ſuffer and undergo then: and that hath the contrary included as implyed. It tells us, we ſhall hunger no more; nor thirſt no more [there will be then no cauſe] neither ſhall the ſun light on them [ſo as to ſcorch them] nor any heat [ſo as to annoy them,] the lamb ſhall lead them to the living
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106759:60"/> ountains of water: [for their refreſhing] and ſhall ſeed them alſo: and <hi>God ſhall wipe all tears from their eyes. Rev.</hi> 7. 17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3. the tabernacle of God, is ſaid to be with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf, ſhall be with them, and be their God: and as <hi>vers.</hi> 4. ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death [we may eaſily gueſs when and where that will be] neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for the former things are paſſed away: all thoſe former evil things, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit of the curſe. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. he that ſate on the throne, ſaid, behold I make all things new: and he ſaid unto me, write; for theſe words are true and faithfull.

                     <head>CHAP XII. <hi>Containing the propoſing to conſideration ſome things which the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hold forth, concerning dominion and power, ſoveraigntie and rule; which the changed people; the Iſraelites eſpecially, are likely to have at the reſtoration, in the world to come, under the Lord Chriſt, being then come, and reigning: with ſome eminent Scriptures, aſcertaining the ſureneſs of the making all good, ſo foretold and declared.</hi>

                     <p>MAn, at his firſt making, was ordered by the great creator, to have dominion and rule over the creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. It was ſaid, in that ſtate: have thou dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106759:60"/> over the fowls of the air, and over every thing that moveth on the earth. Man having ſinned and loſt himſelf; the curſe it entred, and therewith enmitie; not only among the creatures, but rebellion, many times, againſt man himſelf, by ſome of the creatures. God of his great goodneſs and compaſſion, ſo ordered and provided, for a number of fallen man, amongſt whom the enmitie entred, and took place to a great degree, according to his purpoſe, and pleaſure, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I will put enmitie,</hi> not only among the creatures; and man, and the creature, but between men among themſelves: theſe choſen and thoſe rejected; <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> the ſeed, and the ſeed: a great miſtery: I ſhall not treat of it, I only mention the thing, in order to our better proceed in the matter propoſed. The enmity, it began and brake forth betimes; witneſs that of <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. 8. That <hi>Cain</hi> roſe up, and ſlew his brother, righteous <hi>Abel.</hi> This ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a nation, and the line of <hi>David,</hi> had not only the promiſe of dominion and rule; but had the thing it ſelf: haply it may be a type of ſome greater thing to come hereafter: for ſave now and then for a little ſpace; the ſeed of the ſerpent, and not the ſeed of the woman hath had the dominion in the old, and in this preſent world, for the moſt part. Conſult the holy hiſtories and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it will plainly appear: and the ſtate of this day will witneſs to the truth of it. The time is not yet come for the ſeed of the woman, but it haſteneth: our Lord Chriſt will take to himſelf, his great power and reign but he will ſave: then will be the time: in the mean time, the enmitie will continue and grow great: <hi>Dives</hi> will have the day; and the womans ſeed under the Hatches, as was <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> then: but the day will change, the time of refreſhing will come from the preſence of the Lord, and Jeſus Chriſt will be ſent, and come again, and a happy morning for the righteous, when they ſhall have the full dominion, then will that be made good, <hi>Pſa</hi> 49. 14. <hi>The righteous ſhall have dominion over them in the morning;</hi> that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed morning of the raiſing and changing the righteous, they ſhall have the dominion: their day will be, when the Lord Chriſt comes and fully taketh to him his great power and reign: then ſhall great power and dominion be given to the ſaints: for they ſhall reign with him: <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. 6. of which more after. But to proceed in a gradual way, and take knowledge of what the holy ſcripture holds forth, as relating to and eyeing that happy time before mentioned: we may take knowledge, of father <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing of <hi>Judah</hi> his ſon,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106759:61"/> 
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 8. <hi>His hand ſhould be on the neck of his enemies: his fathers children ſhould bow before him. Vers.</hi> 10. <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Judah,</hi> &amp;c. We may alſo take notice of <hi>Balaams</hi> prophecy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 7. 8. ſee the place; the height and fulneſs is like to be then: ſee like wiſe, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. 18. 19. All held forth, which I forbear to ſet down, relateth to a time afarr off, and not nigh. <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. <hi>Out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhall come he that ſhall have the dominion:</hi> a wonderfull time it relateth unto: for, as <hi>vers.</hi> 23. Who ſhall live, when God doth this? he will, he will do it.</p>
                     <p>Then: in the dayes of the dominion and reign of the Lord Chriſt, ſhall that be fulfilled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. acknowledged, and ſtiled, <hi>a Pſalm of Chriſts kingdom,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>In ſtead of thy fathers, thou ſhalt have</hi> [or there ſhall be] <hi>children, whom thou mayeſt make princes in all the earth</hi> [to wit, fully ſo; in the new earth.] <hi>I will make thy name to be remembred, in all generations; therefore ſhall the people praiſe thee for ever and ever. Pſal.</hi> 49. 14. Eyeing the reſurrection, when death feedeth on the wicked in the grave: the righteous ſhall ariſe, and have the day: the dominion, in that very morning: likewiſe, will that be made good then, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 9. <hi>To have power to execute the vengeance that is written:</hi> it is ſayd, <hi>this honour have all the ſaints:</hi> to ſhare with the Lord Chriſt, their bleſſed ſaviour and redeemer, their king and governor, ſure enough to be true and made good then.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, take we knowledge of what holy <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſayth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 12. <hi>The nation and kingdom that will not ſerve thee,</hi> [to wit, <hi>Iſrnel] ſhall periſh;</hi> yea, thoſe nations ſhall be utterly waſted: <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>The ſons of them that afflicted thee, ſhall come bending unto thee,</hi> and <hi>all they that deſpiſed thee, ſhall bow themſelves down at the ſoles of thy feet, and ſhall call thee, the city of the Lord.</hi> That this relateth to the time of Chriſt, and his kingdom, few deny.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall proceed to that eminent place, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. It is after the fourth kingdom or monarchy; ſee what is ſayd, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>But the ſaints of the moſt high,</hi> [to wit, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> eſpecially] <hi>ſhall take, and poſſeſſe the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever:</hi> very great durations not yet begun, it is likely, but will fully be fulfilled, at the reſtoration; when our Lord Chriſt ſhall be ſent the ſecond time; then the ſaints ſhall fully take and poſſeſſe the kingdom. <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. <hi>And the ancient of days came, and judgement was given to the ſaints of the moſt high;</hi> And the time came, that the Paints poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106759:61"/> the kingdom. Some build the fifth Monarchy or kingdom of the ſtone, on this and other the like ſcriptures; apprehending it will be in this world, before the reſtoration and change we have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, which I leave to the day to declare, whether it will be ſo or no: but what holy <hi>Daniel</hi> hath foretold; will ſurely be made good; even that, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. <hi>And the kingdom, and dominion, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the moſt high, whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him,</hi> that is, their governour. There can be nothing more full and plain: only the time is to be waited for: and very like it will be fully fulfilled, when our Lord Chriſt fully takes to him his power and reigns, at the happy reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all things. I ſhall mention no more out of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our Lord Chriſt in the new, hath told us, <hi>that his kingdom is not of this world, Joh.</hi> 18. 36. neither, as I apprehend, is, or to be, in this world, ſave in a ſpiritual conſideration; as the goſpel and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel diſpenſations; as the ſpirit and word; and the fruits of the ſpirit, righteouſneſs, peace, and joy, with faith and love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [though ſome apprehend from thoſe words in the latter part of that verſe, <hi>but now is my kingdom not from hence,</hi> or then; to be ſet up in this world, the emphaſis of the words, as they conceive, lying in the word, <hi>but now;</hi> that his kingdom will begin to be ſet up in this world before his perſonal coming: but I leave it as not being the ſubject matter of this diſcourſe]: but that is clear another thing that we are treating of: from his kingdom in a ſpiritual conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only. It is dominion, kingdom and power, outward and viſible, which our treaty is of: this; our Lord hath not taken to him as yet; he hath not taken to him his great power and kingdom: he is gone to fetch it: when he comes he will bring it with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 12. 15. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. And then; he will fully ſet it up, and reign gloriouſly in the midſt of his enemies.</p>
                     <p>It is much, in my apprehenſion, that any ſhould think, the ſaints of the moſt high, ſhould reign, and have kingdom, and power, and dominion, before the Lord Chriſt; that would anſwer the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes in the holy Scriptures, and be a fulfilling of them: but, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, though ſome ſo think and ſay; yet moſt of them that judge, Chriſts kingdom will begin to be ſet up in this world before his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal coming, do not apprehend, that the prophecyes on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will have their full fulfilling therein; nor will be ſo fulfilled till he ſo comes.</p>

                     <p>Our Lord Chriſt will be then the greateſt monarch that ever was on earth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 25. he will be the only potentate, the king of kings and Lord of Lords: he will be far advanced in power and dignitie, beyond and above all principalities and powers, and might, and dominion, and every name [of power and dignitie, by which the potentates of this world are named] that is named in this world, and that which is to come: far above them all will the Lord Chriſt be then; it will be happy for the Saints then; for he is their head and they ſhall ſhare with him therein: they ſhall reign on earth when he reigneth: he will deligate power to them: they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with great authority, and ſhall reign with him on earth.

                     <hi>A Poſt-ſcript,</hi> or, <hi>an Appendix to the whole.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere are many great Prophecyes and ſayings in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the old and new teſtament, that hold forth very great good things, and a very bleſſed and happy time the righteous ſhall have and enjoy, and be made partakers of, hereafter; when the Lord Chriſt ſhall come, and his reward with him: when the refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing from the preſence of the Lord and the reſtoration of all things ſhall take place; which are recorded to encourage the ſervants of God to believe and hope, and wait patiently, for the appointed time.</p>
                  <p>There are very high atteſtations recorded in the holy Scriptures, of the ſureneſs and certainty of them; which we ſhall a little enquire into; and ſet down for encouragement to believe, hope on, and wait patiently for the great grace, and bleſſed good things, that ſhall be brought unto us, and we ſhall enjoy, at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. I ſhould tire the reader, and as it were, hold a candle to the ſun, to go about to ſet down what might be gathered out of the holy Scriptures, this way: two or three places we ſhall venture to propoſe and ſet down, and leave the reſt. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. likewiſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. we may ſee, how God himſelf, aſſerts his faithfullneſs in his word and promiſes, of good to his people: as ſure, as the waters of <hi>Noah,</hi> the floud that drowned the old world, but ſhall no more do it, ſo ſure will he perform his promiſes of good things to his people. As ſure as he divided the ſea, and made it a way for the redeemed to paſſe over; ſee the places In <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 35. 36. 37. See how the Lord ſetteth forth himſelf, by his greatneſs; in the great works he hath done of old: and upholding of them by his mighty power: the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of heaven, and the foundations of the earth, that cannot be meaſured or ſearched out: ſo will he be in his word, and promiſes to the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his people; ſee the place. And conſider what the prophet <hi>Micha</hi> ſayth <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 20. Thou wilt perform the truth to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and the mercy to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which thou haſt ſworn unto our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from the dayes of old.</p>
                  <p>The words of prophecy, contained in the holy ſcriptures, they are very ſure, very ſtable, ſetled in heaven: confirmed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and oath of almighty God: it is impoſſible for him to lye, or fail; our Lord Chriſt hath given a high teſtimony, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 35. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away but my words ſhall not paſſe away.</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:106759:63"/> Hath he ſpoken and ſhall he not do it? hath he promiſed, and ſhall he not perform it? he hath highly engaged himſelf therein: he is faithful, he is able, he will make it good and perform it. There is nothing hard for him: he is mighty in power, and wonderful in working. What he hath declared by his ſervants the prophets, there ſhall nothing fail thereof; but be made good, in its time.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimony of holy <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. Is very conſiderable, he tells us that the things concerning the kingdom and coming of the Lord Chriſt, are no cunning deviſed fables; but true and real things. firſt, that they were eye witneſſes of his majeſty, to wit, of the Lord Chriſts; ſhewn forth, at the transfiguration on the holy mount, <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 1. What honor and glory he received, when there came a voice to him from that excellent glory; <hi>this is my beloved ſon, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> This voice they heard from heaven, namely, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> being with him in the holy mount, where <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were alſo preſent. Here were three good and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique witneſſes; that both heard and ſaw themſelves; againſt the validneſs of their teſtimony, no exception could be made. They had it not by hear-ſay: but ſaw and heard themſelves: yet he: good humble ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, prefers prophecy before it. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19, <hi>We have a more ſure word of prophecy, to the which, we ſhall do well to take heed.</hi> A very high and bleſſed teſtimony, in the behalf of what the holy prophets have ſpoken, concerning the power, and coming of the Lord Chriſt: and he encourageth the ſervants of God, to take heed unto it, as to a light that ſhineth in a dark place. But it may be asked: how long are we ſo to do? He tells us, <hi>until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> The bleſſed day when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems</hi> light ſhall be fully come, and the day-ſtar ariſe in the heart, and to the heart: when there will be light within, and without: great light; as the light of ſeven dayes put together. When all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes which concern Chriſt our Lord, his coming in power and great glory, and the coming of his kingdom, with all the things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that happy day, ſhall have their full fulfilling and making good: as thoſe former promiſes relating to his firſt coming and the day of his humiliation and ſufferings; had then their fulfilling and making good. Of which, we ſhall ſpeak a little, in a paralel way, with much aſſurance that it will be even ſo, without any the leaſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at all.</p>
                  <p>There is mention in the holy Evangeliſts of many prophecyes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106759:64"/> at the firſt coming of our Lord Chriſt; obſerved, and written, and not in vain. God he is the ſame, and his word is the ſame, and the promiſes relating to his coming again: his ſecond coming will have the ſame fulfilling, and making good whether we believe it, or not. They are all true, and faithful: they are all, <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> touching thoſe in his humiliation, there were ſome of them, at his very firſt coming: and ſome of them were fulfilled, at the end and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of his ſuffering. In like manner there be prophecyes and high ſayings, relating to the beginning of his coming in power and great glory; and the coming of his kingdom, and the things relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And ſome prophecyes relating to the latter end of his kingdom and reign, which will, accordingly, take place, and be accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Take we knowledge of thoſe relating to our Lord Chriſt his firſt coming; the very beginning thereof, <hi>Math.</hi> 1. 22. His incarnation, is ſayd to be on that account; <hi>that it might be fulfilled, which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the prophet</hi> [to wit, <hi>Ifaiah, chap.</hi> 7. 14] <hi>behold, a virgin ſhall conceive and bring forth a ſon, and they ſhall call his name Emmanuel.</hi> A very unlikely thing, and hard to be believed, if reaſon had been conſulted, yet was fulfilled and made good. Our Lord Chriſt was born in <hi>Bethleem;</hi> ſo it was written, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Herods</hi> enquirie where Chriſt ſhould be born, our Lord Chriſt being carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and brought thence, was, that it might be fulfilled which was written, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my ſon. Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. This had been fulfilled before in <hi>Iſrael's</hi> being brought out of <hi>Egyps;</hi> ſo the prophet ſpeaketh of it; yet it had an eye to annother fulfilling, which it had here in our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> cruel murthering the innocent children, was the fulfilling of a prophecy: then was fulfilled that of <hi>Jeremie</hi> the prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 15. <hi>In Rama was a voice heard, Lamentation and bitter weeping,</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel <hi>weeping for her children,</hi> &amp;c. When our Lord came out of <hi>Egypt he went and dwelt in a citie, called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled, that was ſpoken by the prophet, he ſhall be called a Nazarene.</hi> Our Lord leaving <hi>Nazareth,</hi> came and dwelt in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> in the border of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Napthalie, Math.</hi> 4. 13. 14. 15. That, it might be fulfilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>The Land of Zebulon,</hi> &amp;c. The people that ſate in darknes, have ſeen great light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See the places, and conſider them.</p>
                  <p>At the latter end alſo, when he was finiſhing his ſufferings and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: <hi>Judas</hi> his taking of money, thirty peeces of ſilver of the chief preiſts, to betray his maſter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 9. was the fulfilling
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106759:64"/> of a prophecy: then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> the ptophet, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 12. 13. Likewiſe, the parting of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and caſting lots for his veſture <hi>Math.</hi> 27. 35. It was, that it might be fulfilled that is written, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 18. His crucifying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two theives, was that the ſcripture might be fulfilled; that ſayth, <hi>He was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 28. That very remarkable place we may ſee in <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 28. 29. 30. When his ſuffering was neer over; he being then in the very laſt part of it, and knowing that all things were accompliſhed (only, one little thing, as ſome might be apt to think) that the ſcriptures <hi>Pſal</hi> 69. 21. might be fulfilled; he ſayd, <hi>I thirſt:</hi> and they filled a ſpunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyſop, and put it to his mouth: which when he had received the vinegar, he ſaid, <hi>it was finiſhed</hi> [to wit, fully; that being the very laſt thing,] <hi>and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghoſt.</hi> So, as we ſee what great ſtreſſe lay upon it; our Lord could not die till it was done; and then he ſayd, <hi>it was finiſhed, and gave up the ghoſt.</hi> The like ſtreſſe, was on thoſe other things before mentioned; as the parting of his rayment; and caſting lots for his veſture; his going to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and the like; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and fulfilled in the very letter of the ſcripture, without any allegorie or ſpiritual meaning, which many are apt to be putting on prophecyes. Beſides theſe there are many more recorded in the holy ſcriptures, and are not written in vain; which for brevity I forbear to ſet down.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, and in way of proportion and paralel, we may reckon, account, and believe, that all the prophecyes, and ſayings of the holy prophets, and of our Lord Chriſt himſelf, and the holy Apoſtles, written by inſpiration, by the holy pen-men, and writers of the holy ſcriptures, relating to Chriſt our Lord his coming again in power and great glory, and the coming of his kingdom and reign; and all thoſe great things that ſhall contemporize, fall in, and take place, then; of which we have ſpoken before, and are too many to be here ſet down: they ſhall all have their fulfilling, and making good then; theſe of the holy pſalmiſts; of <hi>Iſaiah, Ieremiah,</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel;</hi> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the reſt of the prophets, relating to that time; ſhall then in like manner be fulfilled as they are written.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall particularize a few, out of the new teſtament, and draw to a cloſe. Firſt, that of our Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 31. With all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth to the end of the chapter, as it is ſetdown; when the ſon of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106759:65"/> man ſhall come in his glory, and all his holy Angels with him: then will he ſit on the throne of his glory: likewiſe the gathering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the ſetting them on the right hand, and on the left: the ſaying as is their ſpoken: and judging and ſentencing of them: will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, according as it is written, in all the particulars of it. As alſo that, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 27. and then ſhall ye ſee the ſon of man come in the clouds, with power, and great glory. Every eye ſhall ſee him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. As ſure as the wiſe men ſaw his ſtar, and afterwards himſelf, lying in the manger: or as they in the time of his humiliation, ſaw him ride on an aſſe, and on a colt the foal of an aſſe; as it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 4. 5. Tell ye the daughter of Sion, behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and ſitting on an aſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So as ſure then, when he comes again, he ſhall come in the clouds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in great power, and glory, and every eye ſhall ſee him.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. 10. 11. Which the two men in white apparrel, to wit, Angels, told the diſciples, looking after our Lord, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended: this Jeſus whom ye have ſeen go up into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner, as ye have ſeen him go into heaven; it ſhall then be fulfilled. As likewiſe, that <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. To them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time, without ſin, unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then will be fulfilled that which holy <hi>Peter,</hi> and others have told concerning the burning of this world; and the taking place of the new: a new heaven, and a new earth; according to the promiſe of God: with tho raiſing of the dead in Chriſt, out of their graves; and the changing of thoſe ſaints then alive; in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The reſtoration of all things ſpoken by the mouth of all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets: will be fulfilled as ſure as thoſe things ſpoken by them were formerly when he came before. Then will that be fulfilled, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by holy <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. concerning the waited for adoption; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the body: and the creatures alſo delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God. Then ſhall <hi>Daniel,</hi> as was told by the Angel, ſtand up in his lot, And <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> and all the Prophets; ſit together in the kingdom of God, as it is written. That which holy <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 60. hath foretold; and holy <hi>John,</hi> hath ſhewed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> glory; coming down from heaven, and ſhining glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; with the pure river of water of life, and the trees bearing fruit every moneth: which he hath atteſted to be the true ſayings of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And alſo that concerning the righteous then, that they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106759:65"/> ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt any more, nor ſuffer pain or death, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more for ever: nor no more curſe; the ſayings being true and faithfull, and will be fulfilled: then the righteous ſhall ſee the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that is written, fully made good againſt their wicked oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; their wrongs righted: their faith and patience rewarded: the righteous proceedings of God manifeſted in puniſhing them with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting deſtruction from his preſence; ſuch as ſorely afflicted them, when they ſhall have reſt together: it will be all fulfilled as it is written. Great terror and fear will attend the wicked then; and they will according as it is written, be found, ſaying to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, fall on us, and to the hills, cover us from the preſence of him that ſitteth on the throne. And <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the beaſt, and falſe Prophet; the captains and mighty men; and all their great numbers be deſtroyed. And the devill that deceived them, and death alſo, and the grave, or Hell, be caſt into the lake of ſire, for ever; with very many things of the like kinde, which in a prophetical way, by way of threatning againſt the wicked, are written: it ſhall, then be fulfilled and made good from the faithfulneſs of the Lord <hi>Iehovah</hi> that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould any that believe the the power and faihfulneſs of God doubt of it? why ſhould any think that the things ſpoken of in the holy Scriptures, relating to the Lord Chriſt his ſecond coming in power and great glory, declared by the prophets, and holy penmen of the Scriptures: that thoſe ſhould not as well be fulfilled and made good: as thoſe were fulfilled at his firſt coming, in the ſtate of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and ſuffering? why ſhould any go about to advance unbelief and weak reaſon into the room and place of faith? and conclude, that thoſe things of Chriſts coming and kingdom, are diviſed fables, or things impoſſible ever to come to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>Holy <hi>Peter,</hi> ſtrong in faith, and lively in hope, ſaith, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great things are to be done; (as burning and diſſolving this old heaven and earth, with the works therein, in order to the coming in of the new, in the room thereof) we ſhould be looking for, and haſtning to, the day of their performance: <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. we according to his promiſe, look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſnes. And again <hi>vers.</hi> 14. ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto thoſe that look for him, the ſecond time; he will appear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28.</p>
                  <p>Great good things, will attend the righteous hereafter: a great
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106759:66"/> change for the better will come, when they ſhall enjoy a flouriſhing condition, and abundance of peace and felicity. The bleſſed morning will come when they will come to have the preheminence. The day haſteneth, when they, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> had, will have the good things and be comforted, when the wicked will ſadly ſuffer: the righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the height of their enjoyments of bleſſedneſs, enjoying the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and being for ever with the Lord Chriſt, and having fellowſhip with juſt men, throughly made perfect; <hi>and ſhall live and reign with Chriſt, a thouſand years;</hi> as it is written, and will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. It is impoſſible, that any thing thereof, ſhould fail. or come ſhort. I ſhall forbear to enlarge. The reaſon, and ſcope of the whole, is to infor from what is written, as fulfilled, of the prophecyes, at Chriſt our Lord his firſt coming: to ſhew, what we may look for and expect at his ſecond coming in like manner: remembring, holy <hi>Peter</hi> hath told us, <hi>we have a more ſure word of Prophecy, unto which we do well to taken ed; Hope we ſtedfaſtly, therefore for the great grace, and bleſſedneſs, that ſhall be brought unto us, at the revelation of Ieſus Chriſt. O come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</hi>
